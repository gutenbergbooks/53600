  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The following notes were made during three summer
tours in Brittany, in two of which the Author was accompanied
by the Artist.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Breton Folk</em> is not a description of the antiquities of
Brittany, nor even a book of folk-lore. It is a series of
sketches of a “black-and-white country” under its summer
aspect; of a sombre land shrouded with white clouds,
peopled with peasants in dark costumes, wide white collars
and caps, black and white cattle and magpies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>The illustrations, one hundred and seventy in number,
have been drawn by the Artist from sketches made on the
spot, and, apart from their artistic qualities, have the curious
merit of truth. They have been engraved with the utmost
care by Mr. J. D. Cooper.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /> <span class='large'><span class='sc'>The Western Wing.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>In an old-fashioned country-house there is often to be found a room
built out from the rest of the structure, forming, as it were, the
extreme western wing. It has windows looking to the west, its door
of communication with the great house, and, in summer-time, a southern
exterior wall laden with fruit and fragrant with clematis, honeysuckle,
or jasmine. The interior differs from the rest of the mansion both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>its furnishing and in the habits of its occupants. It is a room in which
there is an absence of bright colours, where everything is quiet in tone
and more or less harmonious in aspect; where solid woodwork takes
the place of gilding, where furniture is made simply and solidly for
use and ease, where decoration is <em>the work of the hand</em>—holding a
needle, a chisel, or a hammer. The prevailing colours in this quaint
old room, which give a sense of repose on coming from more highly
decorated saloons, are blue, grey, and green—the blue of old china, the
grey of a landscape by Millet or Corot, the green that we may see
sometimes in the works of Paul Veronese.</p>

<p class='c000'>This “western wing” is haunted, and full of mysteries and legends;
its furniture is antique, and has seldom been dusted or put in order.
Nearly every object is a curiosity in some way, and was designed in a
past age; on the high wooden shelves over the open fireplace there are
objects in wrought metal work, antique-shaped pots and jars. About
the room are fragments of Druidical monuments, menhirs and dolmens
of almost fabulous antiquity, ancient stone crosses, calvaries, and carvings,
piled together in disorderly fashion, with odd-shaped pipes, snuffboxes,
fishing-rods, guns, and the like; on the walls are small, elaborate,
paintings of mediæval saints in roughly carved gilt frames, and a few
low-toned landscapes by painters of France; on shelves and in niches
are large brown volumes with antique clasps, and perhaps a model in
clay of an old woman in a high cap, a priest, or a child in sabots.</p>

<p class='c000'>The room is a snuggery, well furnished with pipes and tobacco, and
hitherto evidently not much visited by ladies; but the door is open wide
to the rest of the mansion, through which the strains of Meyerbeer’s
opera of <cite>Dinorah</cite> may sometimes be heard. The lady visitor is welcome
to this out-of-the-way corner, but she must not be surprised to find herself
greeted on entering in a language which, with all her knowledge of
French, she can scarcely understand; to be asked, perhaps, to take a
pinch of snuff, and to conform in other homely ways to the habits of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a quiet, unobtrusive corner—pleasant with its open windows
to the summer air, but much blown and rained upon by winter storms—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Brittany, the “western wing” of France, holding much the same
position geographically and socially to the rest of the country, as the
room we have pictured in the great house, to the rest of the mansion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Brittany described in these pages is comprised principally of the
three departments of <span class='sc'>Côtes-du-Nord</span>, <span class='sc'>Finistère</span>, and <span class='sc'>Morbihan</span>,
the inhabitants of these districts standing apart, as it were, from the rest
of France, preserving their own customs and traditions, speaking their
own language, singing their own songs, and dancing their own dances in
the streets in 1879. In these three departments is comprehended nearly
all that is most characteristic of the Bretons, and the district forms
itself naturally into a convenient summer tour of three or four weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brittany is essentially the land of the painter. It would be strange
indeed if a country sprinkled with white caps, and set thickly in summer
with the brightest blossoms of the fields, should not attract artists in
search of picturesque costume and scenes of pastoral life. Rougher
and wilder than Normandy, more thinly populated, and less visited
by the tourists, Brittany offers better opportunities for outdoor
study, and more suggestive scenes for the painter. Nowhere in
France are there finer peasantry; nowhere do we see more dignity
of aspect in field labour, more nobility of feature amongst men and
women; nowhere more picturesque ruins; nowhere such primitive
habitations and, it must be added, such dirt. Brittany is still behindhand
in civilisation, the land is only half cultivated and divided into
small holdings, and the fields are strewn with Druidical stones. From
the dark recesses of the Montagnes Noires the streams come down
between deep ravines as wild and bare of cultivation as the moors of
Scotland, but the hillsides are clothed thickly in summer with ferns,
broom, and heather. Follow one of these streams in its windings
towards the sea, where the troubled waters rest in the shade of overhanging
trees, by pastures and cultivated lands, and we may see the
Breton peasants at their “gathering-in,” reaping and carrying their small
harvest of corn and rye, oats and buckwheat; the women with white
caps and wide collars, short dark skirts, and heavy wooden sabots, the
men in white woollen jackets, breeks (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bragous bras</span></i>), and black gaiters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>broad-brimmed hats and long hair streaming in the wind—leading oxen
yoked to heavy carts painted blue. Here we are reminded at once of
the French painters of pastoral life, of Jules Breton, Millet, Troyon, and
Rosa Bonheur; and as we see the dark brown harvest fields, with the
white clouds lying low on the horizon, and the strong, erect figures and
grand faces of the peasants lighted by the evening sun, we understand
why Brittany is a chosen land for the painter of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paysages</span></i>. Low in tone
as<a id='t4'></a> the landscape is, sombre as are the costumes of the people, cloudy
and fitful in light and shade as is all this wind-blown land, there is yet a
clearness in the atmosphere which brings out the features of the country
with great distinctness, and impresses them upon the mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the antiquary who knows the country, and is perchance on the
track of a newly discovered menhir, long buried in the sands; to the
poet who would seek out and see that mystic island of Avilion,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor ever wind blows loudly”;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>to the historian who would add yet other links in the chain of facts in
the strange eventful history of Brittany; to the resident Englishman and
sportsman, who knows the corners of the trout streams and the best
covers for game, scanty though they be, the tour suggested in these
pages will have little interest; but to the English traveller who
would see what is most characteristic and beautiful in Brittany in a short
time, we should say—</p>

<p class='c000'>Enter by the port of St. Malo from Southampton (or by Dol, if
coming from France), and take the following route, diverging from it
into the country districts as time and opportunity will permit. From
St. Malo to Dinan by water; from Dinan to Lamballe by diligence (or
railway), thence to St. Brieuc, Guingamp, Lannion, Morlaix, Brest,
Quimper, Quimperlé, Hennebont, Auray, Vannes, and Rennes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, then, having set the modern tourist on his way, and provided
for<a id='t4b'></a> the exigencies of rapid holiday-making, let us recommend him to
diverge from the beaten track as much as possible, striking out in every
direction from the main line of route, both inland and to the coast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>travelling <em>by road</em> as much as possible, and seeing the people, as they
are only to be seen, “off the line.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In <cite>Breton Folk</cite> the reader will be troubled little with the history
of Brittany, with the wars of the Plantagenets, or with the merits
of various styles of architecture, but some general impression of the
country may be gathered from its pages, and especially of the people
as they are to be seen to-day.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>On a bright summer’s morning in
July the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ballon captif</span></i>, which we
may use in imagination in these pages—our
French friends having taught us its
use in peace as well as in war—floats
over the blue water-gate of Brittany like
a golden ball. The sun is high, and the
tide is flowing fast round the dark rock
islands that lie at our feet, pouring into
the harbour of <span class='sc'>St. Malo</span>, floating the
vessels and fishing-boats innumerable that line the quays inside the
narrow neck of land called Le Sillon, which connects the city with
the mainland, and driving gay parties of bathers up the sands of the
beautiful Baie d’Écluse at Dinard.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the map on the opposite page, we see the relative positions
of St. Malo, St. Servan, and Dinard, also the mouth of the river Rance,
which flows southward, wide and strong, into innumerable bays, until
it winds under the walls and towers of Dinan. Looking down upon
the city, now alive with the life which the rising tide gives to every
sea-port; seeing the strength of its position seaward, and the protection
from without to the little forests of masts, whose leaves are the bright
trade banners of many nations, it is easy to understand how centuries
ago St. Malo and St. Servan were chosen as military strongholds,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>how in these later times St. Malo has a maritime importance apparently
out of proportion to its trade, and to its population of not more than
14,000 inhabitants.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>St. Servan is built on the site of Aleth, one of the six capitals of ancient Armorica;
there was a monastery here in the sixth century.</p>

<div  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/illus011_smmap.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>From a bird’s-eye point of view we may obtain a clearer idea of
St. Malo and its neighbourhood than many who have actually visited
these places, and can judge for ourselves of its probable attractions for
a summer visit. It seems unusually bright and pleasant this morning,
for the light west wind has cleared the air, and carried the odours
of St. Malo landward. There is to be a regatta in the afternoon,
the principal course being across,
and across, the mouth of the Rance,
between St. Malo and Dinard, and
already little white sails may be
seen spread in various directions,
darting in and out between the rock
islands outside the bay. On one of
these islands, Grand Bé, marked with
a cross on the map, is the tomb of
the illustrious Châteaubriand, a plain
granite slab, surmounted by a cross, and railed in with a very ordinary-looking
iron railing. This gravestone, which stands upon an eminence,
and is conspicuous rather than solitary, is described by a French writer
as a romantic resting-place for the departed diplomatist, characteristic
and sublime—“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ni arbres, ni fleurs, ni inscription—le roc, la mer et
l’immensité</span>”; but as a matter of fact it is anything but solitary in
summer-time, and it is more visited by tourists than sea-gulls. The
waves are beating round it now, but at low water there will be a
line of pedestrians crossing the sands; some to bathe and some to
place <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">immortelles</span></i> on the tomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sands of Le Sillon are covered with bathers and holiday crowds
in dazzling costumes, the rising tide driving them up closer to the rocks
every minute. Everywhere there is life and movement; the narrow,
winding streets of St. Malo pour out their contents on the seashore;
little steamers pass to and from Dinard continually, fishing and pilot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>boats come and go, and yachts are fluttering their white sails far out
at sea. Everything looks gay, for the sun is bright, and it is the day
of the regatta.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking landward, the eye ranges over a district of flat, marshy land,
that once was sea, and we may discern in the direction of Dol an island
rock in the midst of a marshy plain, at least three miles from the sea.
On the summit of this rock is a chapel to Notre Dame de l’Espérance,
and near it, standing alone on the plain, is a column of grey granite
nearly thirty feet high, one of the “menhirs” or “Druid stones” that
we shall see often in Brittany. Eastward there is the beautiful bay of
Cancale, famous for its oyster-fisheries; the village built on the heights
is glistening in the sunlight, and the blue bay stretches away east and
north as far as Granville. Cancale is also crowded this morning, for
it is the fashion to come from St. Malo on fête days, to eat oysters, and
to <em>pay</em> for them. A summer correspondent, who followed the fashion,
writes: “The people of Cancale are amongst the most able and
industrious fishermen in Brittany, and the oysters from the parcs of
Cancale are famous even in the Parisian restaurants; but in the cabarets
of Cancale the charges resemble those of Paris.” We mention this by
the way because travellers who have taken up their quarters at the
principal hotels at St. Malo, finding the charges higher than they
expected, might, without a caution, take wing to Cancale. They may
be attracted thither, for the day at least, to see the fishing operations,
to study costume, to explore the coast by boat, or to visit the island
monastery of St. Michel. The water is smooth in the shallow bay
of Cancale, and the view extending over miles of blue sea to the
green hills beyond Avranches makes a charming picture.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aspect of St. Malo from the sea is that of a crowd of grey houses
with high-pitched roofs, surrounded with stone walls and sixteenth-century
towers, and with one church spire conspicuous in the centre. At
high-water the waves beat up against the granite rocks and battlements,
and St. Malo seems an island; at low water it stands high on a
pediment of granite, surrounded by little island rocks and wide plains of
sand; the spring tides rising nearly forty feet above low-water mark.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>But the chief interest of St. Malo is undoubtedly outside of it. In the
narrow, tortuous streets, shut in by high walls, we experience something
of the sensation of dwellers in modern Gothic villas; we have insufficient
light and air, we are cramped for space, but we know at the same time
that, outwardly, we are extremely picturesque. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rien de triste et de
provinciale comme la ville de Saint-Malo, où tout le monde est couché
à 9 h. du soir; rues noires et tortueuses; pas de soleil, ni de mouvement;
enfin une ville morte.</span>” Such is the popular French view of it in
the height of the season, when prices at the hotels are nearly as high
as in Paris.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fortifications and towers of St. Malo are interesting as examples
of military architecture of the sixteenth century; the castle with its four
round towers was erected, it is said, by Queen-Duchess Anne to assert
her power over the bishops of St. Malo, who had held it from the time
when it was an island monastery. From the ramparts and quays we can
best see many of the old houses and residences of the wealthy traders of
the last century, now dilapidated or turned into barracks or public
offices; and we may also note here and there, in narrow streets, remnants
of carved timber beams and wooden pillars which formed the frontage of
some of the oldest houses. We can walk upon the ramparts all round
the town, from which there are extensive views over sea and land; and
we can inhale, on the western side, the fresh breezes of the sea, and,
on the other, the odours rising from innumerable unwashed streets
and alleys. The church, the spire of which was completed by order of
Napoléon III., has little architectural interest. The structure dates
from the twelfth century, but its present aspect is modern and tawdry,
with a huge high-altar, candlesticks, gilt furniture, relics, and artificial
flowers. The most noteworthy objects are some carved woodwork in
the chancel, and a stained-glass window.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal streets of St. Malo are modernised, and the shops
are full of wares from Paris and Rennes. The appearance and manners
of the people are French rather than Breton, and—although the strange
patterns of the white caps worn by the peasants and fisherwomen,
and the curiously uncouth intonation of voices which already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>greets our ears, remind us that we are very far from the capital of
France—there is little here of distinctive Breton costume.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Malo from its position is an important maritime station. It is
busy, and busier every year, with shipbuilding, for it has a large fishing
population and an export trade with all parts of the world. Brittany is
a food-producing land, and St. Malo is its principal northern port; but
its manufactures are comparatively unimportant, and its retail trade
is largely dependent on the influx of visitors.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the suburb of <span class='sc'>St. Servan</span>, where a few English people live
quietly, there is less appearance of commercial activity than in St.
Malo. It is in fact a faubourg, comparatively unprotected by walls,
and undisturbed by much traffic. Its population of 12,000 have their
principal business in St. Malo, and there is a constant stream of
pedestrians passing to and fro, crossing on a movable bridge worked
by steam, the supports of which are on rails under water. The
principal street of St. Servan is wider than Wardour Street in London,
but it resembles it somewhat in dinginess, and in the fact that its
shops are full of tempting baits for the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bric-à-brac</span></i> hunter; old wood
carvings, pots, and stones, which should be purchased with caution.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bretons, both in St. Malo and St. Servan, are a little demoralised
in summer, and wish to be “fine.” To-day being a fête day, they are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
grande toilette</span></i>, and the wonderful white caps worn by some of the women
are trimmed with real old lace. In the shops and on the promenades the
majority of women are dressed as in Paris, and they wear kid gloves
“like their betters”; the country people and the fishing and poorer class
of Malouins, only, wearing any distinctive costume. The fishermen of
Cancale make money and save it, and send their children to school by
train to Rennes, and the fisherman’s daughter comes back in a costume
that makes her neighbours envious. Every year more white caps are
thrown aside, for Mathilde will not be outdone by Louise; and so the
change goes on, and each year the markets of St. Malo and St.
Servan have less individuality of costume.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, groups such as are sketched are to be seen to-day
in St. Malo, St. Servan, and Dinard: the women in white caps, dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>stuff gowns, and neatly made shoes; the men in blue serge and sabots.
The women’s caps vary in pattern according to their district. They
generally wear a close-fitting under cap, with a small high-crimped
crown, and a wide lappet pinned on the top of the head. In St. Malo
we may see Normandy as well as Brittany caps, and it is not until we
get farther into the interior that the costume of the district is strongly
marked.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><span class='sc'>Dinard</span>—once a little fishing-village, now a fashionable watering-place—the
position of which we see on the map on page <a href='#Page_7'>7</a>, is a
delightful residence in summer, and nearly as dear as Trouville, in
Normandy; but the air is bracing and exceptionally good, the walks
in the neighbourhood shady and delightful, and the bathing in the
sheltered Baie d’Écluse as good as any in France. In Dinard there are
about 800 houses and villas in pleasant gardens, most of which are let
for a short summer season of three months. There is a well managed
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Établissement des Bains</span>” and casino, and several good hotels. Dinard
is the starting-point to reach Dinan by road; also for the little fishing-villages
of St. Briac and St. Jacut, on the coast, westward. At St. Briac
the visitor who does not care to be fashionable will find an inn, good
bathing, and summer quarters of a rougher kind than at Dinard; and
at St. Jacut there is a convent standing almost out at sea, where the
nuns take boarders in summer for a very small sum. At Dinard you
play at croquet on the sands; at St. Briac you scramble over granite
rocks, and fish in the pools under their shadows; at St. Jacut you
wander over the sands with a shrimp-net, and in the evening help
the nuns to draw water from the convent well.</p>

<p class='c000'>But we have come to Brittany to sketch and to note what is most
characteristic and picturesque. So far, on the threshold as it were, what
have we seen? Coming from England, and sailing southward into its
blue bay on a summer morning, there was an impression of brightness
and colour unusual on our own shores. In St. Malo itself three pictures
remain upon the memory. The first is the sunset between the islands
and across the sands, near the bathing-place of Le Sillon; the second
the moonlight view of its cathedral tower at the end of a narrow
street, filling it and towering above it with a grandeur of effect almost
equal to that of St. Stephen’s at Vienna; the third picture is in the small
courtyard of the Hôtel de France. This house, or part of it, belonged
to the family of the Vicomte de Châteaubriand, and it was here, in a
room facing the sea, that the celebrated author and diplomatist was
born. In the hotel the family arms (the peacock’s plume) are
emblazoned, and just outside its gates, in the little dusty square called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“La Place de Châteaubriand,” a new bronze statue, bright and shining,
has lately been erected to his memory. Travellers imprisoned between
the narrow streets and dingy walls of St. Malo, fortified and barricaded
against the fresh breezes of the sea, may perchance seek the cool
courtyard of the Hôtel de France as a place of refuge during the heat
of the day, and, if not quite tired of hearing of Châteaubriand, may
dwell in imagination upon the historic associations of this house. In
a corner of the courtyard, now used as a café, there is an old stone
staircase leading to the first <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étage</span></i>, such as we may see in the courtyard
of many a French château, and upon it there lingers this afternoon
an English girl in the costume most affected by society in 1878. She
wears a rich, dark, close-fitting dress in simple folds, spreading where
it trails upon the rough granite steps with the stealthy grandeur of a
peacock’s tail upon a ruined wall. As she turns her head and leans
over between the pillars of the covered balcony, her “Rubens hat” and
fair hair are framed in antique carved stone. The effect is accidental,
but the harmonious combination of costume and architecture brings
out suddenly the beauties of each, and gives us a glimpse, not to be
forgotten, of the graces of a past age.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>The Rance.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>The tide is now flowing fast up the Rance, filling its numerous bays
and inlets, floating odd-shaped little boats and rafts that are moored off
the villages on its banks, running up here and there inland between
rocks and trees and forming miniature lakes, which will disappear as
the tide goes down. The little steamer for Dinan starts from the Quai
Napoléon, and goes up on the flood in about three hours, having just
time to reach Dinan and return to St. Malo before the water has
subsided. The foredeck is crowded with market-women and small
merchandise, and on the afterdeck, which is but a few yards square,
there are some French and English tourists under a canvas awning,
which is useful alike for shelter from sun, rain, or cinders. Steering
south-east by south, we steam gently up the Rance, getting a fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>view of St. Servan in passing (a view which we should have missed
altogether by the land route to Dinan); a river that, near its mouth,
seems to have no boundaries or banks, that flows in and out amongst
cultivated fields, then suddenly through narrow defiles of rocks and
under the shadow of forest trees that might be Switzerland. Once
or twice we sail, as it were, in an inland lake, or, as the French call
it, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une petite Mediterranée</span>”; we can neither see where we entered
nor any outlet on our route. There are fishing and market boats,
lying in quiet corners, and one or two pleasure yachts with flags flying,
moored in the prettiest spots near modern summer châlets, the
slate roofs of which appear above the trees. We pass one considerable
village, St. Suliac, on the east bank, behind which is the ancient
fort of Châteauneuf; and, on the west, the grey walls of more than
one old château are visible. The water is blue and tidal until we
arrive at a lock a few miles from Dinan, when the little steamer
ploughs through a narrow canal-like stream, and sends the water
flowing over the banks, washing the stems of the poplar trees.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fruit Stall at Dinan.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We are entering Brittany now, and are far out of hearing of the
waves that beat upon St. Malo, and of the band of the casino on its
sands. On either side the valleys are rich with verdure and with
orchards of fruit. There are farmhouses and villas dotted about, and
peasants at work in the fields. We pass close to the banks during
the last mile, and are shut in by rocks and trees; but all at once the
view enlarges, and there rises before us a scene so grand and, at the
same time, so familiar that we feel delighted and rewarded at having
approached Dinan by water. The prevailing tone of landscape during
the last few miles has been sombre, and the valleys in shadow with
their dark granite rocks and gloom of firs have contrasted picturesquely
with the sunshine on distant fields. As we reach Dinan in the
afternoon, the valley of the Rance is in shadow, whilst above and
before us, crowning a hill, are the old roofs, towers, and spires of
Dinan shining in the sun. The sides of the valley here are almost
precipitous, and across it, high above our heads, is a plain modern
viaduct, reaching to the suburb of Lanvallay. Dinan is on the west
or left bank of the Rance; and near the bridge where we land the
steep streets of the old town reach to the water’s edge. Above our
heads are feudal towers, and parts of old walls, and the grey roofs
of houses between the trees, and away southward the valley of the
Rance winding out of sight. We said it was a familiar picture, for
the approach to Dinan by water and the view from the hills on the
opposite bank of the Rance, seen under summer suns, have been
perpetuated in brightness by many an English artist. It is well to
see Dinan thus, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en couleur de rose</span></i>, and to remember it in its most
bright and attractive aspect, for on a nearer and longer acquaintance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>our impressions may change. Dinan—situated on the summit and
slopes of wooded hills, their dark granite sides appearing here and
there through the trees, its mediæval towers and terraces, and its old
grey houses with pointed roofs, and its handsome white modern
houses—forms a good background to the market-women, with their
stalls of fruit and vegetables, peasants in blue blouses, and the
usual summer crowd of tourists, including Parisians in suits of white,
with broad straw hats and blue umbrellas, thronging on the quay
waiting for our little steamer. There are several hundred English
residents in Dinan, and the voices in the streets have a familiar
sound, neither French nor Breton. But the population, including
English, scarcely exceeds 10,000 even in summer; and the inhabitants,
who are not given up to trading with visitors, are principally occupied
in agriculture, or working in their dark dwellings at hand looms.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we climb up a steep, dirty street, leading from the quay, called
the Rue de Jersual, and under a Gothic gateway—past old houses, with
high-pitched roofs and leaning timbers, rising one above another in
irregular steps—we hear the sound of the loom in the darkness on
either side, and the inhabitants come out to stare as usual; shining
red faces, under white caps, lean out from little latticed windows and
from doorways, and in the gutters many a little pair of sabots stuffed
with hay is rattling on the stones. It
is a ladder of cobblestones and dirt, cool
and slippery, sheltered by projecting eaves
from the afternoon sun; the principal
approach from the river a century ago,
up which a stream of pilgrims files into
the upper town. They pause to take
breath at the top, and then disperse on
the <em>Place</em>, where, in front of dusty rows
of trees, the omnibuses and carts, which
have come round by the broad, circuitous
road, are setting down travellers. The
entrance to the inn is blocked by a loaded hay cart, stuck fast in the
archway of the house, as in the sketch. We have ascended at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>300 feet to the <em>Place</em>, and take up our quarters in one of the hotels
in the wide open square, looking as dusty and uncared for as usual
in French provincial towns, and commanding, as usual also, no view
of the country round.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In a few minutes the bustle caused by the arrival of travellers
has ceased, and the principal square of Dinan resumes its ordinary
aspect on a summer’s day. Nurses, in white caps, sit knitting under
the shadows of stunted trees, while the children play in the dust;
cavalry officers of all grades play at cards and drink absinthe at little
tables half hidden by trees planted in boxes at the hotel doors; ladies
and children, a priest, a workman in blue blouse dragging a load of
stones, a woman coming from market, and an Englishman or two, on
pleasure intent, with draggled beard and grey knickerbockers, as is the
fashion of the time. Above the trees, the houses across the square
rise in irregular lines, their steep roofs, old and sun-stained, are full
of variety and colour; behind them tree tops wave, and great masses
of white clouds drive northward to the sea.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
<img src='images/illus016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Dinan is full of interest both for the artist and the antiquary. The
cathedral of St. Sauveur, with its fine carved doorway and Romanesque
architecture, the old clock-tower in the Rue de l’Horloge, the
mediæval gateways, and the old houses in the narrow streets, form
a succession of pictures worthy of study. It is well to examine
the castle, once occupied by the Queen-Duchess Anne and now a
prison, and to ascend the tower, from which there is a magnificent
view. In the museum at the Mairie there are several interesting
monuments and ecclesiastical relics. And yet perhaps the chief
interest of Dinan is in the variety and beauty of its environs; on
every side will be found charming wooded walks and valleys, from
which we can see its position, set high on green hills, the sky-line a
fringe of trees and towers. The walks on the ramparts, with their
lines of poplars and the views across the deep fosse below will
give an idea of the military architecture of the middle ages, and
especially of the natural strength and importance of Dinan as a
fortified city when besieged by the Duke of Lancaster in 1359 and
defended by the brave Du Guesclin. In St. Malo, Châteaubriand was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the hero; in Dinan it is Du Guesclin, constable of France in the
fourteenth century. In the cathedral of St. Sauveur they have
burned candles before the jewelled casket containing his heart, for
centuries, and on the <em>Place</em> there is a poor statue of him in plaster;
but the more lasting monuments are the records of his deeds and the
songs of the people, which we shall hear often on our travels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whichever way we turn in Dinan, we find some new view and
point of interest, and the inhabitants are so accustomed to the incursion
of strangers, and reap so many benefits by their coming, that
we are allowed to sketch almost undisturbed. There is an old woman
with deformed hands and feet, who sits knitting on the <em>Place</em>, whose
familiar figure will be recalled by the sketch on page <a href='#Page_21'>21</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ramparts are comparatively deserted by day, and form a promenade
by moonlight worth coming far to see. If ever there was a
spot on earth prepared for lovers, it is surely the broad walk on
the southern ramparts of Dinan, where the moon shines upon the
path between tall waving poplars and silvers the distant trees, where
there is scarcely a sound to break the stillness, where there is room
for every Romeo out of hearing of his neighbour, and where the
sounds of the city are hushed behind granite walls. It is naturally
romantic and beautiful, and, with the associations which cling around its
towers, has a charm which is almost unique; but we must tell the truth.
There are clusters of white roses clinging to the old masonry above,
which have scattered their full-blown leaves at our feet, and below, in
the deep dell which formed the ancient fosse, there is honeysuckle in
the straggling garden; but the odours that rise on the evening air are
not of roses nor of honeysuckle, nor from the broad champaign around.
There surely was never a beautiful spot so defiled. As a picture, the
general aspect of Dinan will remain in memory—a picture not to be
effaced by the erection of large new barracks, or by the railway now
constructing in the valley—stately Dinan with its ancient groves and
terraces, its hanging gardens, and sylvan views.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
<img src='images/illus017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>We must not linger in such a well-known part of Brittany, or we
would take the reader in imagination to one or two of the old
houses in the neighbourhood, like the one sketched below; also,
a little way up the river, to the picturesque ruins of the abbey of
Lehon. This last is a spot especially to be visited, and where, if
we are wise and have time, we should take apartments for a week
in summer. Another favourite walk is on the opposite side of Dinan,
leaving the town by the ramparts towards the north. Here in the
midst of a tangle of briars and bushes, hemmed in on every side,
run over with ivy and every variety of creeper, shut off entirely from
some points of view by an orchard laden to the ground with fruit and
by a garden of flowers, is the one tower left of the famous château of
<span class='sc'>La Garaye</span> The grey octagonal turret, with its crumbling Renaissance
ornament, stands high above the surrounding trees, and catches
the evening sunlight long after the avenue of beeches by which it is
approached is in gloom. The place is as solemn and quiet, at the end of
a long avenue, as any poet could desire; but as we approach the gates
of the château of “the lady with the liberal hand,” whom Mrs. Norton
has immortalised in her poem, there are the usual signs of demoralisation.
There are pigs about, and tourists; and the show is charged for in the
usual way. We pay our money and take away some souvenir of the
place. Americans who have read (and recited often in their own homes)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>“The Lady of La Garaye” sometimes make Dinan the extreme
western point of their tour in Europe, and have trodden the ground
into a deep track to the château with their pilgrim feet; but the position
is inconvenient for tourists who have much to see, and so, it is understood,
they are going to buy the turret and take it home. The idea is
not as absurd as it may sound; it is a very pretty ruin as it stands, but
it will fall soon if not cared for, and the low wall on either side of the
turret will disappear behind the fruitful orchard. The old hospital is
now used as a farm-shed, but wants repairing to be habitable; and the
ancient cider-press, with its massive wooden beams, lies rotting in the
sun. The farm children are gathering blackberries from the bushes
which grow between the hearthstones of the old banquet-hall, poultry
swarm in my lady’s boudoir, and there is a hum of bees and insects
about the ruin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>We have said nothing of the English colony and church at Dinan,
of the convent of the Ursulines and their good works, or of the
people to be seen on market-days, because Dinan is well known to
travellers, and there is very little to distinguish it from other French
towns. To see the people, and sketch the Bretons in their most
picturesque aspects, we must go farther afield.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we leave Dinan by diligence with much cracking of whips
and jingling of bells, through the wide square tenanted as usual by
white-capped nurses and idlers; rolling in the high <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">banquette</span></i> down
past the old gateways, out into the country road towards the west, we
see the last of Dinan and its towers. Whether in its autumn beauty
with rich surrounding woods, or with its winter curtain folded softly, with
tassels and fringes of frost, Dinan leaves a brilliant impression upon
the mind. We forget the modern incursion of tourists, and the
demoralisation amongst the
poorer inhabitants caused by
the scattering of sous, we
forgive its dingy, neglected
streets, its ill-kept boulevards
and squares, and its slow,
unenterprising ways; we remember
only its grandeur and
picturesqueness.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus019.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we pass out by the
Porte de Brest, we meet a
Breton <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriétaire</span></i> and his
wife in a cart, whom we must
not take for peasants because of the black stuff gown and white
cap of the bright-faced woman, and the broad-brimmed hat and
blouse of the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>We drive through a straggling suburb of houses, where the peasants
stare at us from their dark dwellings; we stop at wayside inns—unnecessarily,
it would seem—and are surrounded by beggars of all
ages and sizes. Here is one who comes suddenly to earth at the sound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>of wheels, and peers from the darkness of her home underground with
the brightness and vivacity of a weasel; her black eyes glisten
with astonishment and with the instinct
of animal nature scenting food; she transforms
herself in an instant from the buoyant
youth and almost cherub-like beauty in the
sketch to a cringing, whining mendicant.
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelque chose, quelque chose pour l’amour
de Dieu</span>,” in good, clear French, nearly all
the words that her parents would have her
learn, in the intervals of playing and road-scraping—the
latter her only serious business
in life. But the schoolmaster is abroad in
Brittany; the edict has gone forth that every
child of France shall henceforth learn the
French tongue; and this little creature will
be caught and tamed, and civilised into ways
that her parents never knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>One more picture on the road, an incident
common enough, but characteristic and worth
recording. It is a sultry afternoon, with a deep blue sky and a
burning sun. So fierce is the heat that it has silenced for a time
the barking of dogs and the arguments of some of our passengers.
Just outside a village the straight road, unsheltered even by poplars,
is fringed with low brushwood and long grasses withering under a
curtain of dust. There is nothing stirring but a little yellowhammer
and a magpie on the road, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cantonnière</span></i> in wide straw hat, chipping
at a heap of stones, and the lumbering diligence in which we travel;
no shelter but in a wood hard by.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently we come to a halt in a narrow part of the road, for
M. Achille Dufaure’s cart of charcoal stops the way. It is a suggestive
picture, which we may call “The Hour of Repose.” In the foreground,
in the burning road, is a tall white charger, encumbered,
now in his old age, with a great wooden collar and clumsy harness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>chained to a dark blue cart with dirt-encrusted wheels, half smothered
on this summer’s day with a blue woolsack over his shoulders, foaming
at the mouth, and streaming with the wounds of flies and other
injuries, but pricking his ears as of old at the sound of approaching
wheels. In the background, but a few yards off, is a cool wood of
beech and elm, dark in its shadows, green in its depth with ivy and
fern, and fringed against the sky with tops of waving poplars. This
broad mass of green, which comes between the brightness of sky
and the burning road, with its foreground of dry grasses, is relieved
on one spot by a cool ripple of blue—it is Achille lying on his
face asleep, his blouse just lifted by a breeze; he will repose for two
or three hours, whilst his horse stands in the sun, and the hot
shadows lengthen from his heels. No amount of shouting on the
part of our driver will waken the sleeper; blessings and curses,
cracking of whips and blowing of horns, are all tried in vain, and
the monotony of our journey is relieved by the diligence being
dragged, as it might have been at first, over the field at the roadside,
and we resume our way.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we travel westward, the aspect of the land becomes suddenly
changed; it is clouded over and rained upon, and is a sombre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>contrast to the former brightness. After the glare of the sun
the senses are grateful for quiet tones; but the sight is strange,
almost mournful. The district is only a few miles from busy towns
and sea-ports, and on the main line of railway from Paris to Brest,
but it is out of the world, and seems, under its cloudy aspect, farther
than ever removed from civilisation; we pass substantial-looking
farmhouses, but the dwellings of the peasants are generally hovels,
with tumble-down mud walls and immovable windows; in their
gardens are dungheaps and stagnant pools of water. We see women
at work in the fields, girls tending cattle, and the men, generally,
looking on.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The distance from Dinan to Lamballe by road is twenty-five miles,
a slow and sleepy journey of about five hours by the direct route; a
journey seldom taken by travellers since the completion of the railway
westward. Everything we pass on the road looks comparatively untidy,
rough, and poor, with the poverty of ignorance and neglect rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of means, for the soil, as we approach Lamballe, is rich, and yields
well. The country is really fruitful, but an acre of land is often
divided into twenty different lots, in each of which there are separate
crops of hemp, buckwheat, or potatoes, or they are filled with gorse
for winter fodder for cattle. The hedges are made of mud-banks,
gorse, and ferns, and the gates between them are formed of felled
trees, the stem forming the upper bar, the roots being left as a
counterpoise to lift the gate on its rough, wooden latch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rain ceases as we approach Lamballe; the air is fresh with
the wind coming from the bay of St. Brieuc, and as the sky clears,
we obtain, at intervals on the undulating road, views over finely wooded
valleys, with high hedgerows, banked up and planted with elms and
oaks. The chestnut trees, wet with the rain, are rich in colour, and
the fields of buckwheat lighten the landscape again. Another turn
in the road, and we are in evening light, there is open pasture land,
and the cattle are winding home; at another, a farmer is meditating
on his stock in the corner of a field. Thus we pass from one picture
to another, quaint and idyllic, the last reminding us more of Troyon
than of Rosa Bonheur.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>It is half past five o’clock on a
summer’s morning at <span class='sc'>Lamballe</span>,
and the deep-toned bell of Notre
Dame resounds through the valley of
The Gouessan. The sun is up, and
gleams upon the roof tops, and upon
the heads of the old women who are
sitting thus early in the market-place,
surrounded with flowers, taking their
morning meal of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage</span></i>. It is market
morning, and the open square in the
centre of the town is filling fast with arrivals from the country. Everything
is fresh from the late rains, and the air is laden with the scent of
flowers, butter, and milk. On every side carts are unloading, and
itinerant vendors are fitting up stalls for the sale of provisions and
goods. There are rows of stalls for the sale of cloth stuffs, shoes,
and wooden sabots, for pots and pans, and for innumerable trinkets
of small value to tempt the peasantry. The shops are opening one by
one, displaying less fashionable, if more useful, wares than we have
seen at St. Malo and Dinan; agricultural implements, and all articles
for the use and temptation of the country people who come from far
to make purchases, bargaining in a rather uncouth tongue, but with a
certain dignity and determination of manner which we shall find
peculiar to the Bretons. Both buyers and sellers speak in a language
apparently half French and half Welsh, and the majority dress in plain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>dark, home-spun stuffs, the men with their blouses, the women with
their caps, all put on clean for the day. This market-place at Lamballe
is a sight, if only to see the fowls and the flowers. It is full of the
killed and wounded, bright plumage and delicate leaves; beauty led
captive by vigorous hands, hustled out of the market-place by rosy,
unsentimental housekeepers; carried heads downwards, both fowls and
flowers!</p>

<p class='c000'>The noise and chattering of a market morning have begun in
earnest, but the great bell of Notre Dame resounds above all; two
other churches soon join in the concert, and the clatter of sabots over
the rough cobblestones up to the church doors adds to the clamour.
It is time to follow the people up the streets, almost too steep for
wheels, which lead to the great church of Notre Dame, built oh the
site of the ancient castle of the counts of Penthièvre.</p>

<p class='c000'>Travellers, especially summer tourists coming from Dinan or Rennes,
on their way westward by railway, seeing the beautiful position of
this town, with its church above the valley, pause sometimes to
consider “whether Lamballe is worth stopping at for a night.” As
we are writing for all, we may tell them, as we pause to take
breath on the ladder of stones which leads to Notre Dame, that
the Gothic pile which crowns the hill before them, whose granite
walls almost overhang a precipice, and from the rocks of which its
pillars and arches seem to spring, is not only full of historic interest,
but has a grandeur of effect in the interior which we shall seldom find
equalled in Brittany. The original structure was a castle chapel, built
early in the sixteenth century, but the present building does not present
many special architectural features of interest, excepting the remains of
an ancient rood-loft and some stained glass. The building has undergone
several periods of restoration down to the present time, when workmen
are busy repairing its outer walls. But the interior, on Sundays
and fête days, is a picture to be remembered, and is especially full of
human interest. The nave is less obstructed with modern ornaments
than usual, and there is a quietness about the services which we do not
find in larger towns. There are the usual wooden cabinets set against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the side wall with green curtains in place of doors; in the centre compartment
there is a dark object concealed, and on one side the skirt of a
woman’s dress peeps from under the curtain; it is only Marie in a new
gown telling some of her sins. There are several women kneeling on
chairs, dressed in dark green or brown shawls, stuff dresses, and neat
strong shoes; all heads turn one way as we enter, the old women,
especially, scanning us from head to foot and mentally taking our
measure as they pray. Here, on this summer morning, crowded with
men, women, and children on their knees, their figures just distinguishable
in the subdued light, the proportions of the lancet arches supported
by clustering pillars, and the stained-glass windows, have a fine effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Lamballe, a sketch should be made, from the valley, of
the church of Notre Dame, with its surrounding houses, walls and rocks
in evening light. The drawing, if accurate, will be considered exaggerated,
on account of the extraordinarily picturesque and commanding site. The
views from the terraces and old ramparts of Lamballe form an almost
complete panorama of the country round. It is a view of rich cultivated
land, covered with crops of cereals, and cattle grazing in the valleys.
Over all this land the great bell of Lamballe makes itself heard in
company with the whistle of the locomotive which hurries travellers
on to St. Brieuc, a distance of twelve miles westward.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <span class='sc'>St. Brieuc</span> we find ourselves in a busy city of 15,000 inhabitants,
apparently too much occupied with trade and agriculture to think about
beautifying their houses and streets. There are many narrow, irregular
streets, in which the old houses have been replaced by others generally
modern and mean; “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une vraie ville de rentiers qui aurait besoin d’être
‘hausmannisée</span>.’” There is a large square <em>Place</em> for the military, and a
market-place near the cathedral, where the old women congregate. St.
Brieuc, as will be seen on the map, is the principal town in the department;
it carries on a large export trade in the produce of the country,
especially in butter and vegetables, for the English and European
markets. Cattle are exported largely from Légué, the actual port,
about two miles off, in the centre of the bay of Brieuc, hidden from
the town by intervening hills.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
<img src='images/illus025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the country round and on the hills overlooking the sea, there
are men and women at work in the fields, girls carrying milk
on their heads from the neighbouring farms, and others busy in
the farmyards. The buckwheat harvest has commenced, and the fields
are being robbed of their rich colour; but the scene is bright with
fresh green and yellow mustard, and rich here and there with clover.
The sombre figures are the peasantry with their dark costumes.
Here we feel inclined, for the first time, to stay and sketch, wandering
along the coast to the fishing villages on the western shore
of the wide-spreading bay of St. Brieuc, visiting the farms and
homesteads, and making studies of the interiors of dwellings. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>rough, wasteful method of husbandry, the old farmhouses with their
one living-room with massive furniture and mud floors, and the
simple manners of the peasants, remind us irresistibly of Ireland, whilst
the names of people and places and the intonation of voices are
altogether Welsh.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Everyone is at work
near St. Brieuc in the
summer months, every
man, woman, and child,
in the fields, on the
roads, or on the shore;
a bright, quick-witted
population, accustomed
to the inroads of
strangers. The inhabitants
are superintended
in their occupations by
some officers of the
line, whose regiments
are quartered near the
town. The soldiers are
sprinkled over the
streets, and dot the hillsides
with colour. The
rattle of drums and the
smoke of innumerable
bad cigars make a lasting
impression in this
city.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Brieuc, or St. Brioc, is the site of a very ancient bishopric,
whose chapter was loyal and powerful to the last. Its history is told
best in the strength of its cathedral walls, and especially in the
ruins of the tower of Cesson, a castle once commanding the entrance
to the bay and the approach to St. Brieuc from the sea. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>little that is remarkable in the churches, and, unless it be some old
overhanging houses near the cathedral, little to sketch in the town
that we shall not find of a better type elsewhere. The business of
nearly everyone at St. Brieuc is to prepare ox hides, tallow, hemp, and
flax, to sell stores for the ships that fit out here for the Newfoundland
cod-fisheries, and generally to provide the agricultural population with
the necessaries of civilisation. The town is as noisy as any French
market-town where soldiers are quartered. In the evening come the
carts from the country, and the clatter of sabots over the stones; at
sundown the regimental drums, at midnight the evacuation of the
cafés, and the songs of warriors going to their rest; at dawn a market
generally begins under our windows. When do these people find rest?
The answer comes laconically from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</span></i> at our inn.
“There is the winter for rest”; and there is the French saying,
applicable enough in this land of noises, that we have “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’éternité pour
nous reposer</span>.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the neighbourhood of St. Brieuc is a picturesque château, part
of which is shown in the sketch; on the sky-line fringing the roof are
metal figures of horses, men, and dogs, typical of the chase.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>There are modern innovations of high white houses, factories, steam
ploughs, plate-glass windows, and smooth pavements to walk on, and the
majority of people one meets in St. Brieuc are dressed in modern fashion,
but there are odd corners, and very odd old men and women in the
by-streets. There is an old woman who sits in the market-place
surrounded by earthenware pots, rather disconsolately, for trade is
bad; but who, facing the last rays of the setting sun, unconsciously
makes a picture which for colour is a delight to the eye; a comfortable
old woman in dark blue dress, with dazzling white cap,
bronzed hands and wrinkled face, all aglow under its snowy awning;
a background of brown and blue earthenware piled in straw, a distance
of dark shadows, and half defined leaning eaves.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus028.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>St. Brieuc is much visited in the summer for sea bathing. The large
buildings near the sea, surrounded by high walls and gardens, are convents
or seminaries, where several hundred children are boarded and
educated for about £20 a year. In the summer the children give place
to adult <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i>, who come from all parts of France for the bathing
season, and the convents are turned into lodging-houses, reaping a
good harvest in spite of the apparently moderate terms of five or six
francs a day. These <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i> spread over the cliffs and sands like
summer flies, to be discerned sometimes in the distance as in the sketch.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It is at a village on the cliff near Fort Rosalier that we first see
men and women winnowing, their arms extended in the breeze, a bright
and characteristic scene recorded exactly in the sketch; a picture soon
to vanish before patent winnowing-machines and other improvements.
Mathurine, one of the party—who
has pinned a clean white band of linen
over her flowing hair and under-cap, and
put on a dark brown embroidered shawl—takes
the opportunity, during the midday
meal of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potage</span></i>, to stand for her
portrait.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>About midway between St. Brieuc
and Guingamp, on the north side of the
railway, is the quiet little town of Châtelaudren.
It is washed and watered by
the Leff, the “river of tears,” which,
coming from the mountains that we see
to the south, winds its way through
rich valleys, seaward. In its course, and
in its time, the Leff has done much
havoc in this peaceful valley, inundating
and destroying Châtelaudren in 1773,
and still occasionally overflowing its
banks. To-day it is to the angler a
capital trout stream, if he will follow
its course southward to the mountains;
to the artistic eye it is a sparkling river
of light, set in a landscape of green and
grey. In the town of Châtelaudren, with
its one wide and rather dreary-looking
street, there is not much to detain the visitor, but it is a good
starting-point from which to explore the country and the Montagnes
Noires. The land is thickly cultivated, and well grown with crops
almost down to the sea; and on every side in this autumn time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>there are signs of industry. From the fields we hear voices of women
at work; in the farmyards there is the dull thud of the flail and
the burr of the winnowing-machine. Across the sloping fields from
the sea come sounds of singing and laughter, disconnected and weird
sometimes, from being caught up by the wind, then dropped and
taken up again.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c000'>Eight miles from Châtelaudren, in a green valley watered by the
river Trieux, is the quiet old town of <span class='sc'>Guingamp</span>. Its past history,
like that of nearly every town in Brittany, has been so eventful that
its present normal state may well be calm; but once a year its
inhabitants neither work nor repose. In the month of September
they hold their annual Fête de St. Loup, and pilgrims come from
all parts of Brittany by excursion trains to the famous “Pardon” of
Guingamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>These religious festivals which are held once a year in nearly
every town in Brittany, and are generally combined with dancing,
fireworks, and other festivities, are the occasion of a great gathering
of the people from remote parts of the country; excursion trains
bring tourists and pilgrims from all parts of France, and during
the week of the fête it is difficult to find a resting-place in
Guingamp. The three principal Pardons are generally held at Ste.
Anne d’Auray in Morbihan, in July, at Ste. Anne de la Palue in
Finistère, in August, and at Guingamp, in September. The Pardon
at Guingamp is held on Sunday and Monday, when processions are
formed to the shrine of a saint a mile and a half outside the town,
indulgences are granted, relics and crosses are distributed, trinkets are
blessed, and sermons preached by the bishop of the diocese to the
people assembled in the open air. After the services there is a fête
in the town, of which the programme on the next page will give the
best idea.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>The religious aspect of these Pardons, and the gathering of the
pilgrims, is sketched in Chapter XII.; we will therefore speak of
Guingamp as it is seen every day. Whether it be from the interest
attaching to the great annual fête, or from reports of the miraculous
cures that have been effected by the patron saint, Guingamp has always
attracted travellers, and has been written of in terms of rapture which
may astonish a visitor when he sees it for the first time. It is a town of
not more than 8000 inhabitants, with one principal street, which winds
irregularly down like a stream, spreading
and overflowing its banks at one
point, in triangular fashion, in what is
called the market-place, then narrowing
again, and working its way through a
suburb of small houses into the great
high-road to Morlaix. It has two monuments—the
church of Notre Dame, and
a bronze fountain in the market-place.
The timbered houses are old, and many
of their gables lean; the cobblestones
in the streets are rough, and the public
square of dust, with withering trees, built
on the old ramparts, looks as dreary as
any we shall see on our travels. But
it is surrounded by green landscape, and
the view from the walks on the ramparts,
seen through the tops of poplars, is of
a green valley with trees and grey roof-tops,
between which winds the river Trieux, slowly turning water-wheels.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus031.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The church was built between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries,
and represents several styles of architecture—Romanesque, Gothic, and
Renaissance. It was originally founded as a castle chapel, and part of
the structure is as early as the thirteenth century. It has three towers,
the centre one having a spire. The interior is impressive, on account
of the simplicity of arrangement for services and the comparatively
uninterrupted view of the nave and aisles; an effect more like that
on entering a cathedral in Spain than in France.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>
<img src='images/illus032.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p class='c000'>Brittany is a land of lasting monuments; and of its buildings it has
been well said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce que la Normandie modelait dans le tuf, la Basse-Bretagne
le ciselait en granit</span>”; but remembering the magnificent
churches we have seen in Normandy, we need not detain the reader
long in Notre Dame de Guingamp. If we were asked by tourists
if the church of Notre Dame at Guingamp was worth going
very far to see, we should answer,
No. It is only as a picture that it
attracts us much. We shall see finer
buildings in other parts of Brittany,
but nowhere a more characteristic assembly.
The most curious feature is
a chapel forming the north porch,
which is open and close to the street, lighted
at night for services, and separated only
from the road by a grille. This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portail</span></i>,
as it is called, forms the chapel of Notre
Dame de Halgoet, and is the sacred
shrine to which all come at the fête of
Guingamp. It is ornamented by rich
stone carving and grotesque gurgoyles.
The people of Guingamp love the chapel
of Notre Dame de Halgoet; it is a
retreat for them by day and by
night, a place of meeting for old
and young, with a perpetual beggars’
mart at the door. This north porch
with its open grille is a house of call
for rich and poor of both sexes, and
placed as it is in the centre of the town, abutting upon the principal
street, it forms part of their everyday life to go in and out as they
pass by. It is one of the many welcome retreats in France;
in a land of perpetual noises and glare, of shrill, uncouth voices and
latch-less doors, it is the church that gives us peace and shade.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
<img src='images/illus033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the centre of Guingamp is its market-place, and in the centre of
the market-place is a fountain, consisting of a circular granite basin with
a wrought-iron railing. There is a second basin of bronze, supported by
four sea-horses with conventional wings, and a third by four naiads;
the central figure is the Virgin, her feet resting on a crescent. This
fountain was constructed by an Italian artist, and its waters played for
the first time on the night of the annual Pardon, in 1745. The history
of Guingamp is not complete without recounting the story of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>construction of this fountain; but regarded from a picturesque point
of view, the smooth green bronze with its Renaissance ornamentation
harmonises neither with the surrounding houses, with their high-pitched
roofs and pointed turrets, nor with the towers of Notre Dame. We
are more interested with the living groups which furnish the wide
market-place in the morning sun.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>A few yards from the cathedral, on the
opposite side of the street, is the old Hôtel
de l’Ouest, where travellers are entertained in
rather rough but bountiful fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take a little trout or salmon, caught this
morning in the Trieux, a little beef, a little
mutton, a little veal, some tongue, some omelettes,
some pheasant, some fish salad, some
sweets, some coffee, and then—stir gently,”
is the prescription for travellers who stay at
the Hôtel de l’Ouest. As this is an average
hotel, it may be worth while to state that the
bill presented (by the young lady in the sketch)
to <em>three</em> English travellers, who spent a night
and part of a day there, was 12 fr. 80 c.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excepting at the time of fêtes, Guingamp
is almost as quiet and primitive in its ways as in the days of the
Black Prince. Our notes of days spent in this city in different years
are the most uneventful in our records. On one summer’s morning
we hear an unusual sound from the great bell of Notre Dame, and
find a procession of priests and choristers winding up the principal
street, followed by hundreds of the inhabitants. What is the occasion?
“The mother of the Maire is dead; she was a bountiful lady, beloved
by all, and we are to bury her this morning.” And so the inhabitants
turn out <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, and march with slow steps, for about half a mile,
to the cemetery. It is a dark, silent stream of people, filling the
street, and carrying everything slowly before it; the only sounds
being the chanting of the choir, and the repetition of prayers. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>follow to the cemetery, which is crowded with graves, each headed
by little iron or wooden crosses, hung with immortelles. The procession
divides and disperses down the narrow paths, a few only
of the friends of the deceased standing near the grave.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>At one corner of the cemetery is a shabby little wooden building,
like a gardener’s tool-house, which seems to excite much interest. A
girl, with shining bronzed face, in a snow-white cap, holding a little
child by the hand, is coming out of the door; we venture to ask the
reason of her visit. “Just to
see my father for a minute,” is
the ready answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a little wooden box, about
the size of a small dog kennel,
is her father’s skull or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</span></i>, as it
is called; he is tumbling over
with his friends in other boxes
exactly as in the sketch, which,
rough as it is, has the grim
merit of accuracy. The sight is
a common one in Brittany, but
it is startling and takes us by
surprise at first, to see at least
fifty of these shabby boxes,
some on shelves in rows, but
generally piled up in disorder
and neglect. The lady who is being buried so solemnly this morning
will some day be unearthed, and her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef</span></i>, in a box duly labelled and
decorated with immortelles, will take its place in the ossuary of
Guingamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the high ground near the cemetery, and especially from a
hill a little farther from the town in a north-easterly direction, we
obtain a good view of Guingamp and of the country round. There
is a mound, covered with smooth grass, clumps of gorse, and tall fir
trees, through which the wind moans on the calmest day; a spot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>much favoured on summer evenings by the youth of Guingamp.
Looking round over the thickly wooded but rather sombre landscape,
and on the old grey roofs of the town, one is a little at a loss to
account for the rapturous descriptions which nearly all travellers give
of Guingamp. On a fine summer’s morning the landscape is seen to
perfection; but to tell the truth about it, the scene is not very striking
either for beauty or for colour. Guingamp has been described as “a
diamond set in emeralds,” and we read of its landscape “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riant</span>,” and
so on. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guingamp m’a pris le cœur</span>,” says another traveller; but their
interest is in the past, they people it with memories, and with the
events of past years.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our business is with the present aspect of Brittany, and we are
bound to record that Guingamp, excepting at the time of the Pardon, is
a very ordinary place indeed. The artist and the angler may linger
in its valleys, and make it headquarters for many an excursion. If
we might suggest one walk to them, we should say—</p>

<p class='c000'>Go out of the town in a south-easterly direction, following the
course of the river Trieux on its right bank for half an hour, and you
will come to a suburban village, with a rough wooden cross (like the
one sketched on page <a href='#Page_89'>89</a>) raised aloft in the centre of the street, and
the bright and trim new stone spire of a chapel conspicuous amongst
its irregular roof-tops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turn round to the right hand, just by the cross, and enter a large
farmyard; the women are busy winnowing, not with hands upraised
in the wind, as we have seen them at St. Brieuc, but twirling by hand
a new patent blue-painted rotatory winnowing-machine with a burring
sound, in a cloud of choking dust. They are storing their harvest
in a large barn, the remains of an ancient Gothic church, the abbey
of Ste. Croix, with its choir window piled up with straw. Immediately
in front are the farm buildings, part of a round tower and a corner
turret standing, and much of the old woodwork and massive interior
fittings is still preserved. The garden reaches to the river, where
ancient and historic trout disregard the angler of to-day. The farm
and its surroundings are as picturesque as any painter could desire.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>The inhabitants of this suburb have a real grievance; they had
lived for generations in familiar sight and sound of the cathedral of
Guingamp; they saw its spire and towers at evening, standing out
sharp and clear against the western sky, and were in feeling living
almost in the town itself, when suddenly the engineers of the “Chemin
de Fer de l’Ouest” threw up a mountain of earth in their midst, and
shut out the town and the sunset light from them, and from their
children, for evermore.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>Twelve miles north-east of Guingamp
is Lanleff—“the land of tears,” celebrated
for one of the most curious architectural
monuments in Brittany, the circular
temple of Lanleff. Leaving Guingamp, we
pass through a solitary wooded country, the
undulating road soon rising high above the
valley of the Trieux. The air is fresh and
invigorating, and the views from the summits
of the hills extend over a wide range of
land. At Gommenech we enter the valley of the Leff that we
passed at Châtelaudren. There is no prettier river, or one that
should more truly delight an artist’s eye, than the Leff in its long,
winding journey from the mountains to the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sheltered by woods, shut in here and there by granite walls, with
ruins crowning the heights, between green banks and through sloping
fields, it is one of those picturesque rivers which are peculiar to
Brittany of which we seldom hear mention, but which many an English
angler knows well. The view of Gommenech is to be remembered as
we cross the valley on our way to the temple of Lanleff; the temple
is in ruins, and partially unroofed, but enough remains of the original
nave supported by pillars, and its outer circle of aisles, to give us a
perfect idea of the structure, which resembles closely and has, doubtless,
the same origin as the round churches in England built by the
Crusaders on their return from the Holy Land. The diameter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>church to the walls of the outer aisles is not more than 20 feet; in
the inner circle, or nave, the twelve arches are round and Romanesque
in style, with rude carvings on the capitals. A chancel was afterwards
built into the original structure, so that the unroofed walls of the temple
formed, as it were, a vestibule to the parish church, and in this circular
open porch, under the shadow of a yew-tree, the congregations used
to kneel. But the people now assemble in the new parish church on
the hillside, and the temple is kept for show. The “holy well with
its blood-stained stone” is pointed out to visitors; the pieces of oolite,
that encircle the well, show shining red spots when wetted, to mark
the place where, according to tradition, “an avaricious priest received
money from a father who sold his child to the Evil One.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We listen to the story gravely, and certainly no sign of doubt, or
of levity, passes over the grave face of the Breton woman who tells
it; we are in a land of historic monuments and traditions of the
past, and the people who live at Lanleff are too wise even to smile
at the interest travellers take in these things. The story has been
handed down from father to son, from mother to daughter, and is
now passed on to tourists who can master a little of the Breton
tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Continuing our journey northward, we soon arrive at the summit
of a hill overlooking the bay of Paimpol and the thickly wooded
country round; we have passed good country-houses on the route,
with flower-gardens skirted by hanging woods; and as we approach
Paimpol, there are houses scattered in sheltered bays, with fishing
and pleasure boats aground; an old church surrounded closely by
houses, a little <em>Place</em>, a custom house, a quay, boatmen, and fisherwomen;
but—where is the water? It has retreated for more than
a mile, and the long bay or estuary and the port of Paimpol are
a desolate waste of mud. Paimpol is a small but busy fishing
village, much frequented in summer by the French for bathing.
It is not fashionable, but the inns are comfortable, and the
country is full of attractions for the summer visitor. The houses on
the <em>Place</em> and in the narrow streets are old and weather-worn; some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>are dark and mysterious-looking, and have that peculiar smuggling
aspect with which we soon become familiar on this coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a corner of the quiet churchyard of Paimpol there reposes at
full length, in stone, “L’Abbé Jean Vincent Moy,” many years <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</span></i>
of this place and honorary canon of St. Brieuc; and round about
him, placed thickly in rows, the former inhabitants of Paimpol rest
under black wooden crosses. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curé</span></i> is carved in dark green stone,
from which time has taken the sharpness of the chiselling; but the
expression is life-like, representing him in the popular act of blessing.
There is a cup of holy water at his feet, supplied by an old woman
who kneels before the tomb on the damp ground. It is her pious
office to guard the tomb of her pastor, and brush off the leaves which
fall thickly from the grove of elms overhead. They move slowly
and die leisurely at Paimpol; this old woman’s time is not yet, for
she “has only eighty years.” In four newly made graves there repose
Eugénie, Marie, Mathilde, and Hortense, and their respective ages are
eighty-two, eighty-four, eighty-eight, and eighty-nine!</p>

<p class='c000'>At Paimpol in summer every one seems to take life easily, the
French visitors driving about, bathing, boating, and living perpetually
in the fresh, pure air; the native inhabitants getting up boat-races,
and dancing the “gavotte” at night, in streets lighted by paper lanterns
in old Breton fashion, as we see sketched at Châteauneuf du Faou.
There is unusual brightness on this sombre, storm-washed shore; there
is the dazzle of a crimson pennant, and the flashing of a snow-white
sail; there are green banks, in contrast to water of the deepest blue,
for in these little inlets of the sea the summer sun clothes
everything with brightness in a moment. Perhaps we have seen
Paimpol <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en couleur de rose</span></i>, for there has been blue sky overhead
nearly every day for a fortnight, and the sun is so hot at midday
that the market-women put up their red umbrellas, and the men
descend into cool cellars for shelter and refreshment.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a favourite walk, of about a mile, to a promontory on
the south side of the port, by a pathway skirting fields of corn and
buckwheat, which brings us to high ground and a shady plantation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of firs, where we lose sight of Paimpol itself, but obtain the best idea
of the surrounding scenery. We choose this walk a little before
sunset on a day when there is a high tide. At our feet, on the left
hand, is a steep bank with tree-tops <em>below</em>, their dark foliage contrasting
with the blue of the water and the orange stems of weather-worn
firs. Looking far away northward and eastward across the
water, dotted with white sails coming in with the tide, the island
rocks light up brilliantly in the setting sun. The air is so clear
seaward that we can distinguish little houses on the island which
guards the port, and on more distant rocks far out to sea, all glittering
in the sun. Turning southward, to the real bay of Paimpol, which we
cannot see from the town, the opposite banks are in shadow, and the
foliage which reaches to the water’s edge takes a rich purple tinge.
The outlines are soft and indistinct, excepting on a tongue of land
in the middle of the bay, where in the midst of a garden of fruit-trees,
and surrounded by ivy-grown walls, we can just trace the Gothic lines
of the abbey of <span class='sc'>Beauport</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a shaded walk of about a mile and a half from Paimpol
to Beauport. The road and the by-paths are shut in by high
banks, so that we come upon it rather suddenly, looking down upon
the ruins, through the bare windows of which we can see the
sea. The Gothic chapel is a complete ruin, but part of the abbey
building is in good preservation, and inhabited. One room is turned
into a school-house, and a great roofless hall, once the refectory,
is used as a threshing-floor. The romantic aspect of the ruins of
Beauport, with its surrounding scenery, has been described in every
book on Brittany, and the view of it by moonlight over the bay
of Paimpol is as famous as that of “fair Melrose.” To this ancient
abbey come pilgrims of the nineteenth century to study and wonder
at the art of life shown by the monks of the thirteenth. If ever
there was a spot where nature and art seem combined for man’s
special enjoyment, it must have been at Beauport. Here the fruitful
land meets the bountiful sea, and there is no arid line of demarcation;
the corn waves at the water’s edge, and the flowers bloom and shed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>their leaves into the water. The soil is rich, and the air is soft, and
in this autumn time the harvest seems everywhere ready to man’s
hand—a harvest of fruit and grain on land, a harvest of fish and rich
seaweed spread at every tide upon the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The abbey of Beauport is considered by M. Merrimée to be “the
most perfect example of the monastic architecture of the thirteenth
century”—in fact, the most important and beautiful ruin in Brittany.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in34'>“It lies</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep-meadow’d, happy, fair with orchard-lawns</div>
      <div class='line'>And bowery hollows, crown’d with summer sea.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we wander round the gardens and through the avenues of trees
that line the raised walks on the breakwater, or under the shadow of
high brick walls, laden with old fruit-trees, it is easy to realise in our
minds the lives of its former occupants. The picturesqueness of Beauport,
especially the view, from the eastern side, of the chapter-house
and other dwellings, should attract artists. This afternoon there is
one large white umbrella planted firmly in the gravel of its deserted
walks, and one canvas spread with a green landscape in which old,
grey, mullioned windows, and the stems of weather-beaten trees, form
prominent features.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Paimpol to Lannion is twenty miles by the road, crossing
the river Trieux by a lofty suspension bridge at Lézardrieux, and
halting at the ancient cathedral town of Tréguier by the way.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Tréguier</span>, as will be seen on the map, is well situated for exploring
the coast and for visiting a variety of places of interest in the neighbourhood;
and it is a town in which the artist and the antiquary
would desire to stay. The cathedral with its graceful spire, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">percée au
jour</span>,” and its old market-place, with the streets leading from it, form
pictures more characteristic and interesting than anything we have
seen in Dinan or Guingamp. Tréguier, which was one of the four
original bishoprics of Brittany, abounds in historical associations.
Everywhere we hear of “St. Ives,” or “St. Yves” (the lawyers’
patron saint), who lived here in the thirteenth century, and who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>buried in the cathedral by the side of Duke John V. From Tréguier to
the sea there is a wide estuary, capable of floating, at high tide, vessels
of large tonnage; and it was here that the famous expedition against
England by “Constable Clisson” in the fourteenth century was to
have embarked. The shipbuilding which is carried on at Tréguier and
the views on the banks of the estuary are not the least picturesque
points to notice. The cathedral is in a variety of styles; it has a
north porch of Norman work, and a
square tower, “the tower of Hastings,”
of the eleventh or twelfth century,
and some beautiful cloisters of the
fifteenth. It might be worth while
to stay at Tréguier if only to examine
and sketch the interior of an old
Breton farmhouse in the neighbourhood,
containing the bed of “St.
Ives,” and other relics of the patron
saint; here too we are within easy
reach of the remains of the castle
of “La Roche Derrien,” with its fine
views northward over the sea.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus038.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is near Tréguier that we make
the discovery of a watering-place,
Perros-Guirec, where we can live in
the height of the summer season for
five francs a day, and where it is
difficult to spend more. The bay
of Perros-Guirec is just sufficiently off the track of tourists to make
it delightful in summer. There are two small inns on the shore, one
at either extremity; but the actual village of Perros-Guirec is situated
amongst the trees which crown the northern promontory of the bay;
there are a few summer-houses and gardens, an old church, and near
it a convent, where in July and August strangers may board for a
small sum.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>It seems hard to break up the peace of this retreat by printing a
description of it, but here, we are bound to record, is a spot where
we can spend our summer days with the greatest delight. We can
live as we like, dress as we like, bathe in the water at our feet, sit
and sketch in the shade of woods, through the branches of which
we see the shining sea. The air, so fresh and bracing, sweet with
the breath of pines, is more grateful in the hot summer months than
at Dinard or Trouville, and the sights and sounds are certainly more
healthful and restful.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evening as we return from a walk by the sea north of
Perros-Guirec; before us is a wide and beautiful bay, extending for
nearly half a mile in a noble curve of shore; it is shut off from
the land by sloping hills, and bounded at either extremity by rocks.
The tide is nearly out, and the sand is as pure, smooth, and untrodden,
as on Robinson Crusoe’s island. There are no projecting rocks or
stones on this wide plain, nothing to be seen on its surface but our
long dark shadows and two little crabs, behind their time, making
hard for the retreating water. We cross the bay leisurely, treading
lightly on the carpet of sand, and watching the sunset light on the
rocks and on the little islands which make this coast such a terror to
navigators. They are smiling this evening in that roseate hue which
storm-washed red granite rocks put forth on gala days, and their
purple reflections in the water are as deep and glowing as from the
steep walls of the Lago di Garda under an October sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two crabs soon disappear in the water, but as we cross the
bay, two other little spots appear at some distance on the sand. The
sight is so unusual here that the thought of Crusoe on his island
occurs again, and we approach cautiously. The objects are larger
and farther off than at first appeared, in fact nearly a quarter of a
mile; they consist of two neat little bundles of clothing, one of which
appears to be a silk dress surmounted by a white straw hat! There
is nothing near them but sand, no sign of human creature; but,
presently looking seaward, the mystery is explained by two heads
appearing suddenly on the surface of the sea, one with long hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>floating from it. We beat a retreat and learn afterwards that an
evening walk in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce pays ici</span>” is often supplemented by an evening
bath. Thus Monsieur and Madame, strolling together on the sands,
make a diversion without ceremony or “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">machines</span>,” and without the
slightest “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A little to the north of Perros-Guirec is the village of Ploumanach,
almost built out into the sea. It is a place to be visited above all
others on this coast for its wildness, and to see the hardy fishing
population, living amongst a loose mass of rocks, nearly surrounded
by water. Looking northward, on a clear day, we may see a group
of islands that form, as it were, outworks of granite protecting the land
from the waves that break upon this shore. One of these islands, the
abode of innumerable wild-fowl, is said, with doubtful authority, to be
the Island of Avalon, or Avilion, where King Arthur was buried.</p>

<p class='c000'>All round these rocky promontories the inhabitants live more on
the sea than on the land; they look to the sea for their harvest, and
glean on the shore rather than in the fields. The children of this
seafaring community, when tired of the earth, take to the water
naturally, and it is not an uncommon thing to see the mother of a
family rush from her cottage, lift up her skirts deftly, and jump into
the sea to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal town in this neighbourhood is <span class='sc'>Lannion</span>; it is a
natural commercial centre for the surrounding districts, collecting and
dispersing the produce of the sea and of the shore, and busy also in
providing and fitting out vessels for the mackerel-fisheries. It is a
busy town, with a fixed population of about 7000, but apparently with
accommodation, and occupation in the busy seasons of spring and
autumn, for a much larger number. Lannion dates from the twelfth
century. It is picturesquely situated on the steep slope of hills above
the river Guier. The market-place in the centre of the town, from
which steep streets descend to the river, is remarkable for its curious
old houses, but nearly all traces of local costume have vanished. So,
too, has vanished the antique tapestry representing the story of
Coriolanus, and “a staircase up which a regiment of grenadiers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>could march in double columns,” which used to be shown at the
Hôtel de l’Europe. In their stead we find plate-glass shop fronts,
good pavements, and little children seated on dirty doorsteps dressed
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la parisienne</span></i>. On market-days the country people come in wearing
their old costumes, and a few well-to-do farmers and their wives, who
put up at the best inns, are dressed in the old homely fashion of the
Bretons of the Côtes-du-Nord.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus039.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Lannion, at the time of writing, may be said to be one of the
outposts of French tourist civilisation in the Côtes-du-Nord. Hither
come in summer-time a few Parisians, and families from the interior,
for the bathing; driving to and from Perros-Guirec and other places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>on the coast daily, but seldom actually staying on the seashore. In
their train come the latest fashions, both in manners and in dress,
and it is here we may notice, especially on Sundays and fêtes, the
strange contrasts in costume between the Bretons and “the French,”
as the natives persist in calling their visitors.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is on their way down to the Jardin Anglais one Sunday
morning that a gay Parisian and his wife walk through the market-place
and down one of the old steep streets; behind them come nurse
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bébé</span></i>, all “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en grande toilette de l’été</span>.” The lady wears a white
dress, which trails over the cobblestones; the gentleman is in brown
holland, with white shoes, white tie, and a new straw hat shaped like
a Prussian helmet and decorated with a crimson band; the baby is
decorated in as much of the fashion of the day as its size will
permit; the nurse, the neatest of the party, wears a spotless white
cap and dark short dress. An old dame, seated at her doorstep,
taking a bountiful pinch of snuff, emits a harsh sound, more like
“Jah!” or “Yah!” than the customary approving “Jolie!” which comes
so trippingly on every French tongue. The Breton woman, in her
old-fashioned gown, black stockings, and neat stout shoes, who owns
the house she lives in, and perhaps half a dozen others, regards the
fashionable visitors with anything but pleasure, and resists the advance
of fashion into Lannion as an evil almost equal to an inroad of
Prussians.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Lannion the most interesting buildings will be found in the
neighbourhood of the Grande Place, where some curious slated “hoods,”
and projecting roofs, break up the perpendicular lines of the modern
buildings; enough remaining even now to account for the frequent
descriptions of its picturesqueness. The church of St. Jean, with its
high terrace overlooking the valley, is interesting principally from its
commanding position above the town. From its terraces and between
the stems of its dusty trees there is a pretty sight on Sunday morning
when the people crowd to the neighbouring church of Brélévenez.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking northwards across a deep ravine—through which a once
clear, rapid stream rushes full of soap into the river Guier—we see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>that in course of time it has worn its way through rocks, washed the
slight covering of earth from the roots of trees that grow on its
steep sides, that it has been utilised to turn water-wheels, dashing in
and out of holes in wooden houses built over its banks. It has
“washed” for Lannion for hundreds of years, and every summer’s
evening down by the bridge, the women, old and young, may be seen
on their knees at work on wet boards. On the opposite side of the
ravine the houses rise one above the other in a series of steps to the
church of Brélévenez with its fine spire cresting the hill; and it is
up and down these steps that on Sundays and fête days the people
crowd in a dark procession all day. The ascent is steep indeed, and
the young have to help the old to make the pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we follow the crowd across the ravine and up this narrow way,
we find that it has been selected by suffering and poverty-stricken
humanity as a public mart. The path is so narrow and steep that
there is no escape from the beggars that line the way. In the churchyard
at the top it is a pretty sight to see the country people meeting
and chatting together under the trees, standing in groups waiting for
the service. They are evidently accustomed to the beggars; but it
seems hard upon Marie and Mathilde, coming on a summer’s morning
through the fields to church, to have to run the gauntlet of so much
misery and disease, to have hideous deformities thrust upon their
sight, and curses hurled at them if they do not give. A stranger is
of course fair game—he is Dives, and Lazarus is waiting for him at
the gate; but all are importuned alike, and every hideous artifice is
used to extract alms under the protection of the church. The women
and children push their way bravely, slipping over the stone stiles
modestly one by one, their neat short skirts being suited to the work.
The air is fresh and sweet, blowing through the churchyard; but
inside the church the crowd is great, and the heat almost insufferable.
The beggars do not go in, at least not many of them, but they lie
in wait and line the descent of this ladder of life, sunning themselves
in corners until the pilgrims pass down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Lannion, a word should be said about the inn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>accommodation, because it is exceptionally good. They may be small
matters to record in print, but it will be useful to travellers to
know that in Lannion they will find at the principal inn the comforts
of civilisation, including an excellent cup of tea. After a few
days’ stay at the Hôtel de l’Europe the illusion will be dispelled
that in travelling in Brittany, away from railways, it is necessary to
“rough it,” as the saying is. In all the principal towns on our
route the hotels will be found as good as in Normandy and
other parts of western France; and throughout Brittany we get
abundance of good meat, bread, butter, milk, and wine. At the
Hôtel de l’Europe at Lannion, English families come to stay, it being
quieter and less crowded than Dinan, as well as a convenient centre for
visiting some of the most interesting spots in Brittany; interesting to
English people especially for their historical and romantic associations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everyone makes a short stay at Lannion, in order to visit the
thirteenth-century castle of Tonquédec, in a lovely valley about
eight miles south of the town. It is easy to reach it by taking
one of the diligences on the road to Guingamp to a point about
five miles from Lannion, or by taking a carriage direct. At the
time of writing, this castle is one of the best preserved specimens
of military architecture in all France, and it is to our mind one
of the beauty spots in Brittany. Time has covered its towers and
walls with thick and luxuriant foliage, graceful in line, and altogether
picturesque from its untrimmed aspect; in autumn time it is as rich
in colour as a pheasant’s wing, and the lines of the landscape which
surround it are as varied as the waves of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The castle of Tonquédec was one of the ancient strongholds
of Brittany; the present structure is in great part the restoration of
Henry IV., and the ruin the work of Cardinal Richelieu; time and
ivy having done the rest. It is rare to find, as at Tonquédec, so
“complete a ruin,” if we may use the word, showing the plan
and structure of its different courts, its fortifications, and surrounding
dwellings, as used in the thirteenth century. We must not dwell
upon architectural details, but we may mention the views that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>to be obtained from its windows and towers, the adjoining park and
avenues of old trees, and the lake with its ancient carp asleep under
the banks, who—according to the women in charge of the castle—“have
lived so long that their tails are worn out”!</p>

<p class='c000'>At Lannion and Tonquédec we are on the border-land which
divides the departments of the Côtes-du-Nord and Finistère. The
little river Douron, which takes its source in the Monts d’Arrée, and
falls into a bay between Plestin and Lanmeur, marks the boundary
of the departments and also of the ancient bishoprics of Tréguier
and St. Pol de Léon. There is a natural division between the
two departments in the general aspect of the country and
demeanour of the people. From the hanging gardens of Beauport
and the sleepy orchards and cornfields which surround Lannion
and Tonquédec we shall shortly pass to a wilder and sterner part
of the coast, dominated by the cathedral spires of St. Pol and Le
Folgoet.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>Thus far we have spoken of the northern
coast, where the busy inhabitants of the
Côtes-du-Nord come most in contact with French
traders, and travellers of different nations. Let
us now turn towards the mountains, where the
country is less fertile, the people are more isolated,
and there is more character and local
costume to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we leave the Western Railway at Guingamp or Belle-Isle-en-Terre,
we may follow the course of the streams which take their rise in the
Monts d’Arrée, and, passing through Callac, reach Carhaix the same
evening. We cross the purple mountains where the solitary shepherd
in goat’s-skin coat (sketched on page <a href='#Page_68'>68</a>) tends his flocks on poor
pastures, and where the, almost equally solitary, Englishman is busy
with a fly-rod. At Callac, where comfortable quarters are to be
obtained, many Englishmen stay for the fishing and shooting seasons;
the streams are well stocked with fish, and there is little difficulty in
getting permission for fishing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The game laws are very strict in France, as is well known;
the opening and closing of the shooting season varies every year,
the prefect deciding the day in September when shooting may
begin. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasse courant</span></i>, which includes hunting the wolf and the
wild-boar, commences about a month later. The seasons close at
the end of January, and whenever snow is on the ground.
Altogether there is more attraction for the angler than for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>sportsman in Brittany, and there is no better centre for the angler
than Callac.</p>

<p class='c000'>The aspect of the people and their dwellings in this neighbourhood
is more simple and primitive than we have yet seen; and
the features of the peasants are more strongly marked with the
privations of generations. It is the same dull round of life,
labour, and hardship, with a few gleams of sunshine in summer;
and a Pardon and a blessing from the priest at the annual fête.
There is the same story everywhere. “We move slowly; we do as
our fathers did, and live contentedly as they lived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>How did they live sixty years ago? An Englishman who spent
some time in Brittany in 1818 says of the peasants:—“They
are rude, uncivilised, simple, and dirty in their habits; they live
literally like pigs, lying upon the ground and eating chestnuts
boiled in milk as their principal food. Their houses are generally
built of mud, without order or convenience, and it is a common
thing in Brittany for men, women, children, and animals to sleep
together in the same apartment, upon no resting-place but the
earth covered with straw.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> This was written sixty years ago, but
the mud houses are before us, and the description holds good
to-day. Forty years later a writer in an English newspaper is sent
to report upon the state of the agricultural labourer in Brittany;
what does he find? “The Breton peasant,” he says,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> “is still
isolated from the towns by his language. He has kept himself
apart, and mistrusts the outer world. His fare is black bread,
made of buckwheat, or rye, oats or barley, boiled with milk. If
he have a change in his diet, it is in the shape of potatoes. His
life is an unbroken monotony. He never changes his manners, his
habits, or his dress. He is a stranger in the large towns, where
even his language is not understood, save by a few people who
deal with him. He is as patient and quiet as a beast of burden;
his daily hard labour seems to subdue even his affections, it leaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>him no time for grief, no hours for the indulgence of remorse, no
moment for despair.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Twenty years later, what do we find? Excepting in a few districts,
such as that near Lannion, where there is a considerable advance in
agriculture, and where the peasant’s position is better, we find the same
figure wearing the same coat, standing just where he did; his life the
same weary round of labour by day, and rest in
an old mud hovel at sundown. The problem of
a life of labour and monotony is yet unsolved; he
is just where he was in 1850, and where his father
was in 1820. The great Chemin de Fer de
l’Ouest, that was to do so much for the owners
of the land and the tillers of the fruitful soil of
Brittany, which has been driven through the heart
of the country, with its enormous viaducts and
its trains of cattle trucks; which has thrown up
embankments of earth that shut him off from
the rest of the world, appear to have done little good. A train
rushes past his patch of land several times a day, and perhaps his
priest is in it, on his way to Paris or Rennes; it no longer startles
his children or his pigs, for it has passed now for years; but “traffic,”
or what is generally understood by the term, scarcely exists, and
passengers, excepting in summer, are few and far between.</p>

<p class='c000'>A step higher than the peasant, and we find the farm people,
all working on in the old grooves, and, excepting in the matter
of sending their children by train to be educated (which to a
certain extent is compulsory), and in the gradual use of modern
agricultural implements, showing little signs of change. Nearly all
the farms are worked on a small scale, and with the least employment
of capital. “Thrift, thrift!” is the watchword with them all;
early and late they labour, man, woman, and child, and year by year
gain a little on the past; a piece more land, a few hundred francs
put by; but they live on in the same humble, penurious way, with
little care or trouble about the outer world, and knowing little of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>movements. Their very charities are an investment by the teaching
of their own church: a sou is given to a beggar without grudging, for
shall it not be repaid? Thus on the one side we may contemplate
a life of work and thrift, which is admirable, and a conservatism
which keeps the soil in the hands of the labourer; but on the other,
the view is of a race behindhand in civilisation, wanting in knowledge
and in sympathy with the rest of mankind.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>We descend the hills from Callac, following the course of the river
Aven to <span class='sc'>Carhaix</span>, the ancient capital of a province and the centre of
a large agricultural district, owing its present importance to its cattle
fairs. At ordinary times life is peaceful enough at Carhaix; in the
principal square is the Hôtel de la Tour d’Auvergne, where visitors
can live as comfortably as in any country town in France, and where
the days resemble one another very closely. Every afternoon the
people sit and sun themselves in the principal square, as in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>sketch below, and pigs lie down undisturbed in the middle of the
street; every evening the inhabitants walk under the trees on the
dingy <em>Place</em>, with its avenues of limes, where there is a fine view
over the country, and where is Marochetti’s bronze statue of La Tour
d’Auvergne, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le premier grenadier de France</span>.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus044.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Between two and three o’clock in the afternoon there is the only
communication with the outer world, when, with much cracking of
whips and rattling over stones, a crazy vehicle called “the courier,”
with its lame and battered horse, covered with dust and foam, comes
lumbering in. It brings a packet of newspapers, chiefly local; for
Carhaix cares little for the doings of the world beyond that of which
it is the centre. But we must now speak of the fair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Six roads converge upon Carhaix, and upon these roads, and
across the open land, on a summer’s morning, comes a stream of horses,
cattle, pigs, and people. It is the day of the cattle fair, a day for
meeting and marketing for all the country round; a day of rejoicing,
bargaining, and of cruelty to animals scarcely to be paralleled elsewhere;
the day and the place to see the Breton farmers and cattle-dealers,
to study the costumes and the ways of the peasants from some of
the most primitive districts of Brittany.</p>

<div id='Market'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus045.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>ON THE ROAD TO MARKET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>It is only four o’clock in the morning, but the sounds of shouting (in
strong Breton tones, which seem to Englishmen a perpetual echo from
the Welsh hills), the lowing of cattle, the shrieking of pigs, and the
heavy thud of sabots resound upon the roads. On the rising ground
just outside Carhaix, on the western road, we can see them through
an avenue of trees coming across the country in narrow defile, like
the commissariat train of an army on the march; the men leading
cattle, the women on horseback and on foot, laden with provisions;
and others in holiday attire, arriving in country carts.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The sun shines full on the wrinkled faces of the men, and on the
white caps of the women, and lights up the group with unwonted
brilliancy; even the sober costumes of the people with their blue and
brown stuffs, and the black, and white and fawn-coloured, cattle which
they lead, would, if recorded faithfully by a painter, stand out in
high accents of colour against the low-toned land; a rustic picture
so fitful and vanishing that only the rapid artist, who has presented
Brittany to us in these pages (as it has never been pictured before),
could depict. It is the sunny side of Brittany in all its quaintness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the pastoral aspect of life which those who dwell in cities seldom see.
There is nothing to mar the beauty of the morning, for the noise
of the market is as yet a distant sound, mingled with the bells of
Carhaix for early mass; there is nothing to suggest a change but
the gathering of the clouds towards the west, and the stout umbrellas
and cloaks carried by the women.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus047.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us follow them, later in the day, to a large square where the
fair is held, and where there are wonderful sights and sounds; under
the trees a crowd of men and women, in the dust and heat, horses,
cattle, and pigs, in perpetual movement, with much drinking and
shouting at the booths which line one side of the enclosure. There
are a great many horses for sale, which do not find buyers, although
the government agents are here from the neighbouring <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haras</span></i> at
Callac, and horse-dealers have come from all parts. The cattle
market is overstocked, and the little black and white cattle, a cross
between Alderneys and Bretons, go for very small sums to reluctant
purchasers. The pig market is more active, as every Breton peasant
likes to possess a pig, and the noises proceeding from this part of
the square are deafening. The gentleman farmer in blue blouse to
keep off the dust is the portrait of a prominent figure moving amongst
the crowd.</p>

<img src='images/illus049.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The meetings of the country people, and the groups sitting under
the trees to rest, are as suggestive pictures as we have seen, and the
costumes are full of variety and interest; the whole forms a scene
of which the full-page sketch gives an accurate idea. These markets
are held several times a year, and for a few hours disturb the quiet
of the sleepy town of Carhaix.</p>

<p class='c000'>We could well stay at Carhaix, for the scenery is varied and
interesting, and there is much to observe in the farmhouses in the
neighbourhood; old furniture, old carved bedsteads, cabinets, and
clocks; old brass-work, old lace and embroideries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pictures come to us at every turn, pictures of domestic happiness
and content, only to be seen in byways far removed from cities and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>their troubles; family groups, in which our presence seems sometimes
an intrusion. Brittany, like Spain, is a country that should be travelled
through cautiously; the inhabitants live out of doors in summer-time,
and perform various domestic operations in the roads, regardless of traffic.
Turn a corner suddenly and you may come upon a scene of family
discord, or affection, where you are of necessity <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de trop</span></i>; take a walk in
the evening in the outskirts of a town, and the mute aspect of the
people, one and all, is that the road belongs to them, that the dirt
and the dunghills of the poorest are heirlooms which no invading
sanitary inspector shall reform.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus050.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>In the farmhouses in the neighbourhood we shall often find but
one living and sleeping room—kitchen, sitting-room, bedroom, all in
one; the bedstead of carved oak, the cupboards and chests with
brass handles and bosses, the copper cooking utensils bright and
shining, the floor at the same time being of bare earth. There
is often a dungheap outside,
and a shed for cows opening
into the living room, which
is common alike to pigs, fowls,
and children. We see the
women coming out of their
dark, unhealthy dwellings on
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span>-days, looking bright and
clean, with old lace in their
caps, embroidered shawls, and
the neatest of shoes. We
see them thrashing corn and
scattering the grain wastefully
on the ground, and
farming on a small scale
in primitive fashion. But
the Bretons who live thus
are nearly all prosperous and
thrifty in their own way;
they own most of the land
they farm, paying rent, for a portion perhaps, at the rate of twenty or
twenty-five francs an acre, but adding to the extent of their ownership
year by year. Nearly everyone we meet at Carhaix is engaged in
agriculture, and the majority are well-to-do. The land yields well,
and there is the Canal de Brest passing through the town to take the
produce to the coast.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Waiting for Dinner, Huelgoet.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Turning northwards towards Morlaix, we pass through somewhat
dreary scenery, until we come to a gorge near Huelgoet, which,
with its rocks and rushing streams, will remind us of Switzerland;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>here are some ancient lead and silver mines, which were a source of
considerable wealth in the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a silent and deserted air about the streets of Huelgoet,
seldom disturbed by the sound of wheels; at the inn where we rest
our dinner is cooked in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle à manger</span></i> at the open fireplace,
and from the manner of the people it is evident strangers are rare,
even in summer. We are asked by the taciturn landlord to take
up our abode here “for the sake of the fishing,” and a book is shown
containing the names of visitors who have staid at the inn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road between Huelgoet and Morlaix, passing over a spur
of the Monts d’Arrée, is again wild and desolate; we see flocks
scattered over barren pastures, and men and women at work on
open ground far away from habitations. It is a suggestive part of
Brittany for the landscape painter, a dark lonely land of rugged
outline, full of poetry and mystery.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>From the quiet of Carhaix and the solemn
landscape which surrounds Huelgoet to
the bustle of Morlaix, only sixteen miles to
the north, seems a rapid transition. If we
arrive at Morlaix by railway, we cross a lofty
viaduct over a deep ravine, and, far below,
see clusters of grey roofs, white houses, rocks
and trees, church towers, and factory chimneys.
Descending to the town, we find ourselves in
the centre of more commercial activity than
we have seen since leaving St. Malo. Morlaix
is a prosperous town, containing about
15,000 inhabitants, busily engaged in trade.
It is built at the confluence of two streams,
the Jarlot and the Queffleut, which meet in the centre of the city,
and (arched over for some distance in their course) wind down the
valley to the sea, six miles away. On either side of this canal-like
stream are quays, and rows of houses, old and new, strangely
intermixed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The commercial traveller, the shipper of native products, and
the importer of foreign goods is ever busy at Morlaix. But its
aspect is still essentially old; its outward characteristics are primitive:
weather-worn gables with carved beams, steep streets and rough
pavements with open gutters, and, in the centre of the city, a dingy
river, with washerwomen on its banks. The sketch gives an exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>idea of the scene as enacted every day in the principal street;
but the old architecture of Morlaix is best indicated on page <a href='#Page_72'>72</a>. A
few demolitions take place every year, but, visiting Morlaix for the
third time in 1878, we find the most interesting buildings standing
and leaning against each other as of old. Tradition is strong in
this city, and many new shops preserve over their doors their old
signs, the ancient insignia of the trades of the merchants of Morlaix.
Some are grotesque figures carved in wood, painted and gilt; there is
one little figure, for instance, at the corner of the Rue Notre Dame,
“Au Sommeur Breton,” in cocked hat and curled wig, which carries
us back in imagination several centuries.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>In the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rue des Nobles</span>,” where the high-pitched roofs and
overhanging eaves nearly meet across the street, we may see the
actual dwellings of the nobles of Brittany in the fifteenth century,
whilst above on the steep hillsides, and all around, are the modern,
meaner, and more healthy dwellings of the traders of the nineteenth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The approach to Morlaix by water in the old days, when at
the last turn of the river the pointed gables and towers came into
view, must have been very picturesque. Its aspect in 1505, when the
nobles received the Queen-Duchess Anne on her pilgrimage through
Brittany, and later—when Mary Queen of Scots landed here on her
way to Paris to espouse the Dauphin in 1548—we may picture to
ourselves, with some regret, as we walk down the new wide Rue
de Brest, and see above us the great railway viaduct. It is a strange
medley of grey roofs, trees, rocks, towers, factory chimneys, quays
lined with stores, precipitous streets, tottering dwellings, and defaced
churches (one turned into a granary), arched over by the modern
railway viaduct, from the view of which there is no escape, but which,
from its very height and solidity, has a certain grandeur of effect. But
the old is quite overwhelmed by the new, and even the steep hillsides
seem dwarfed by the giant proportions of the viaduct. There is not
only more movement, but there is more colour in Morlaix, than we
are accustomed to in Brittany; down on the quay, for instance,
there are red sashes, and clothing of bright Oriental hues, drying
in the wind; and there is a certain Eastern air about the open shops
in the old quarters which tells of distant commerce. But the present
prosperity of Morlaix is in its tobacco manufactories, in its trade in
butter, grain, fruit, &amp;c., and in its position as the natural place of
export for the products of a fruitful part of Brittany.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is well to stay at Morlaix to make sketches of some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>lofty interiors with their carved staircases, some of which are quite
unique; and it is well to see it on Sundays, for nowhere shall we
see pleasanter faces or a happier and brighter-looking population.
On market mornings the country people crowd the <em>Place</em>, and, in
the morning and in the evening, five
or six hundred factory hands, men
and women, pass up and down the
Rue de Brest. It is a familiar
sight, but the neat caps and dark
homely attire of the women
are again delightful to see. The
brightness, style, and vivacity, of
the women of Morlaix leave a
distinct impression on the mind.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the neighbourhood, in the direction of Brest, are two of
the most famous calvaries and churches of the Renaissance, St.
Thégonnec and Guimiliau. It is half an hour’s journey by train
to the little deserted station of St. Thégonnec, on the railway
to Brest, and a mile to the north is the village. There is
no one at the station but the station-master, and no communication
with the village of St. Thégonnec excepting by a covered
cart, which meets the morning train. The fine church, which stands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in the midst of a straggling village of dilapidated houses, pigsties, and
dirt, is rich in sculpture and gilding in the style of the Renaissance;
on the high-altar, on the pulpit, and in the side chapels are elaborate
carvings, much overdone with gilding and restoration, but grand in
general effect. In the churchyard all is grey, sad-looking, and
dilapidated; the ancient calvary, erected in 1610 in dark Kersanton
stone, is injured and time-stained; the quaint figures, elaborately
carved, representing passages in the history of Christ (dressed in
ruffs and gowns of the sixteenth century), are roughly propped up and
stuck together, for the benefit of pilgrims who come to the shrine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The calvary of St. Thégonnec, like most others in Brittany,
depicts scenes in the life and Passion of Christ. In the centre is a
group of three crosses, representing the scene of the Crucifixion, with
figures of the centurion and soldiers, angels, and the Virgin and St.
John, and on either side are the two thieves. Below, round the base
of the structure, are figures in Breton costume, representing the
judgment of Pilate, Christ bearing the cross, the Entombment, and
the Resurrection. Some of the figures are remarkable for animation,
and, in spite of the state of the monument, appeal more powerfully
to the imagination than a group of coloured life-size figures representing
the Entombment which is shewn to visitors in the crypt.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For a sketch of one of the calvaries, see page <a href='#Page_91'>91</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The church and calvary of Guimiliau is in a quiet village a few
miles to the south-west, a short drive from St. Thégonnec, crossing
the railway. The church dates from the Renaissance, and is rich in
carving and decoration; the interior is loaded with ornament, the
eastern end being a mass of crude colours and florid decoration.
In the south porch is some elaborate carving, and in the organ loft
are some bas-reliefs on the oak panels. There is a baptistry of
carved oak, consisting of a canopy with allegorical figures, supported
on eight spiral pillars, around which are twisted vine leaves, fruit,
flowers, and birds. The pulpit, dated 1677, is also a remarkable
work of art. But in the churchyard, time-stained and crumbling to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>decay as usual, is the great object of our visit, a solid stone structure
raised upon arches, upon which is a crowd of little carved figures in
the costume of the sixteenth century, representing the various scenes
of the Passion. There are saints in the niches at the corners, and
high above is a crucifix, with the figures of Mary and St. John on
either side. This monument dates from 1580, but many of the
figures have been restored at a later date.</p>

<p class='c000'>Altogether the calvaries of St. Thégonnec and Guimiliau, whether
regarded from a picturesque or antiquarian point of view, are the
most interesting monuments we have yet seen; interesting in their
very loneliness, the object of so much thought and labour in the middle
ages, left thus neglected and in ruin. The calvaries of Brittany seem
little cared for, excepting as curiosities; but once a year, at Easter
time, there are religious ceremonies connected with them, when special
services are performed, and the various scenes depicted on the
monuments are explained to the people. Then is the time to visit
St. Thégonnec and Guimiliau, when the people are seen gathered round
the sculptured crosses, in the same costumes and in the same attitude
of faith as their forefathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the time we left St. Thégonnec station until our return in
the evening, after visiting these two calvaries, we have seen few
people in the fields or on the roads. The busy city of Morlaix
absorbs all available hands, and leaves the country towns almost
deserted. When the railway was advanced at an enormous cost
through a difficult country to the port of Brest, it was thought,
naturally enough, that it would open up traffic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i>; but here at
St. Thégonnec no one comes. “I live,” says the station-master, “in a
vast solitude, the monotony of which is only broken by the passing
of five or six trains a day; scarcely any one comes near me; a
stray tourist or two in the summer, and an occasional visit from a
wolf in winter, one of which has killed my favourite dog.” This
station-master, whose daughter was being educated at Morlaix, kept
a brood of turkeys for distraction; but it was “a lonely life,” as he
said, a solitude the more keenly felt because he was connected by a
telegraph wire with the headquarters of the administration of the
Chemin de Fer de l’Ouest. “It was solitude without peace, for at any
moment, day or night, the bell might ring.” It is difficult to realise
that this is on the main line of railway between Paris and Brest!</p>

<p>POTATO-GETTING NEAR ST. POL DE LÉON.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>There is no stranger or more suggestive contrast for the traveller
in Brittany than to leave Morlaix on a summer’s morning and
drive twelve miles in a north-westerly direction to St. Pol de Léon.
It takes only three hours, but in that short journey we pass, as it
were, from life to death, from the commercial activity of to-day to
a stillness which belongs to the past. The passage is from wharves
and warehouses, from crowded factories and the shrieking of steam,
to open country, hill and dale, to the sea. In Morlaix the monuments
are to commerce, in St. Pol de Léon to the church; in Morlaix there
is activity and a certain amount of civilisation, in St. Pol de Léon, by
contrast, there is stillness, poverty, and degradation. Our last view
of Morlaix is of a stupendous railway viaduct, of comfortable villas
and trim gardens; our first view of St. Pol de Léon across the open
land is of three noble church spires standing out sharply against
the sky. Ancient stone crosses and images of saints in glass cases
are passed as usual on the roadside, before we approach Léon, “the
Holy City,” which five centuries ago, when Morlaix was unknown,
was an important bishopric and the centre of great ecclesiastical
wealth. To-day its aspect is poor and dreary, even in sunshine; grey
and cold in colour, and generally dirty.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the cathedral with its spires and the tower of the church of
Notre Dame de Creizker (nearly 400 feet high) are the absorbing
points of interest, the reason of our journey to St. Pol.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inhabitants, numbering about 7000, are principally agricultural,
or are employed at the port; fishermen and knitting women, reserved
and dignified in manner, living rough homely lives, disdaining many
of the modern ways of Morlaix, but having a keen eye to commerce,
which they carry on actively with far-away places, including Norway
and Greenland.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>
<img src='images/illus057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we saunter up the rough, ill-paved streets of the cathedral
square, the men come out of the cafés and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débits de tabac</span></i>, and
give us a rough but not unkindly greeting, as in the sketch. The
principal occupation of our three friends is to cultivate potatoes,
cabbages, onions, asparagus, and other vegetables for foreign markets;
for this part of Brittany forms one vast market-garden, whence the
cities of Western Europe are supplied. The inhabitants who live in the
cathedral square have grown up in perpetual wonderment (expressed
in their faces) at the summer procession of pilgrims to St. Pol de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Léon; pilgrims in strange costumes, who dispense sous to their children,
inquire for the keys of the tower of the Creizker, and then mount
several hundred feet above them in the wind.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The cathedral dedicated to St. Pol is a fine example of early
Gothic architecture, noble in proportions, rich in carving and sombre
in colour, the dark green Kersanton stone giving a fine effect to the
interior, in which some white-robed nuns are generally to be seen
on their knees. The nave is thirteenth-century work, there is some
florid carving on the south porch, and a fine rose window; above are
two towers, with lofty lancet windows, and spires which remind us of
churches in Normandy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the spire of Notre Dame de Creizker—literally, “Our Lady
of the Middle Town”—which is higher than the cathedral towers, is
the most interesting object in St. Pol; the central point round which
the lives of the Léonnais radiate, a landmark seen far and wide by
land and sea. This spire, built in the fourteenth century, in the reign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of John IV., Duke of Brittany, is supposed to be the work of an
English architect. The tower is of granite, richly ornamented with
a projecting cornice, and its spire is pierced through to the sky.
The beauty and magnificence of the churches of St. Pol de Léon are
out of all proportion to the present importance—or unimportance—of
the place. The inhabitants have little sympathy with the art of the
sixteenth century, or with the Druidical remains they find in their
fields, but they welcome travellers gladly in the nineteenth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a wide plain round about St. Pol, from which the Gothic
spires seem to reach to heaven, and where a human figure, standing
in a field, points upwards with strange emphasis against the sky;
a district peopled by classic-looking market gardeners, whose children
walk in groves of cabbages five feet high, and play at hide and seek
in their shadows.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Gurgoyle at Roscoff.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Three miles north of St. Pol is the little sea-port of Roscoff,
historically interesting as the landing-place
of the child princess Mary Queen
of Scots, who passed through Roscoff
on her way to Nantes in 1548. There
are the ruins of a chapel founded by
her, still standing on the seashore; in
the church, with its open belfry tower,
are some curious alabaster reliefs; and in
the neighbourhood, in a convent garden,
is a gigantic fig-tree, said to be two
centuries old. Roscoff is now used as
a bathing-place, and there is a constant
passing to and fro in summer between
this port and a little island three miles
farther north, the Île de Batz, where
a hardy population of fishermen and
women ply their dangerous trade, with hardly any communication
with the shore in winter. It is almost worth while to cross to the Île
de Batz to see the “Druidesses,” as the women of the island
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>are called, assembling on Sundays in their island church; and it
might be worth while for a painter to make a longer stay in this
neighbourhood, to make studies (if only for colour) of some of the
curious figures to be seen in such out-of-the-way corners as Roscoff.
Here is one of an old man with long hair and semi-nautical
aspect, who sits in the evening on a stone seat in front of the
cottage which he owns, facing the sea; a poor man to outward
appearance, but an owner of
the soil; his face is screwed
and weather-worn, his clothes
are patched in various shades
of brown; his blouse is of a
dark and greasy tinge; his
working life has been spent
in the fields or down at the
port, but his final cause is
undoubtedly to smoke; he
has coloured by degrees, like
a good old pipe, and his
sabots have caught the true
meerschaum tinge; he has
smouldered at Roscoff for
many years, and seems ready
for burning, stacked against
the wall like the fagots collected for winter fires. There is no difficulty
in making a sketch, for this rich-toned “owner of the soil” of Finistère
has a perfect contempt for strangers, and is as immovable as the
gurgoyle sketched on the preceding page.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us now turn westward in the direction of Lesneven and Le
Folgoet, to see one of the finest churches in Finistère. There are
two roads to Lesneven, of which we would recommend the traveller
to take the one to the north, near the sea. The country is for the most
part dreary in aspect, but there are some curious wayside crosses on
the route. There are a few fields of buckwheat, corn, and rye,
banked up by high hedges, and skirted by pollard trees. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>one of those drives which should be taken leisurely by the antiquary
or the archæologist; a route where there is little to remind us of
the present, and much to bring before us the habits of the past.
Every monument we pass on the road, every hovel at the roadside,
and nearly every peasant in the fields, is of the pattern of a past age.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus061.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>As we skirt these quiet shores of northern Finistère, we may listen
for a moment to a story just five hundred years old, a story that
every Breton peasant that we pass on the road knows by heart: how
a poor idiot named Salaun, who lived in the neighbourhood of Lesneven
for forty years, and begged for his bread in the name of the
Virgin, uttering only the words, “Ave Maria,” was found dead by a
fountain and buried on the spot; how a white lily grew upon his
grave, with the words, “Ave Maria,” inscribed upon the leaves; and
how John of Blois, then fighting for the dukedom of Brittany, hearing
of the “miracle,” vowed that, if successful in battle, he would erect a
church to Notre Dame de Folgoet, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> “Fool of the Wood.”</p>

<div id='Folgoet'  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus062.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>IN THE CHURCH OF LE FOLGOET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The church was completed by his son, John V., about 1420. It
was built like most of the churches and monuments of Finistère, of
the dark Kersanton stone found near St. Pol de Léon, and at the
village of Kersanton, near Brest. The church consists of a lofty
nave and aisles under one roof, with a long projecting transept on
the south side. The great beauty of the church is in its carving,
that on the south porch being perhaps the finest. The great west
door, now falling into ruin, is elaborately ornamented with wreaths of
the vine and other devices, and above it is a bas-relief representing
the Nativity and the Adoration of the Shepherds. In the beautiful
south porch, which is supposed to have been added by the Queen-Duchess
Anne, are the arms of Brittany and figures of the twelve
apostles in niches, and round its roof are traces of a richly carved
parapet. In the interior there are five altars, with carved figures of
angels, birds, and flowers; and on the rood-loft, between the choir
and nave, supported upon elaborately carved pillars, is some open
tracery cut in stone, in good preservation. There is a fine rose
window, as at St. Pol de Léon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spring, or Fool’s Well, is under the high-altar, and the water
flows into a basin <em>outside</em> the church. It is here that the sick and
needy come and kneel before a statue of Our Lady set in a Gothic
niche, and bathe their limbs in the water of the miraculous well; a
retired spot, where, at all hours of the day, peasants are to be found
on their knees in prayer.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have given but slight descriptions of the churches of St. Pol
de Léon and Le Folgoet, but enough to indicate that here at least
the traveller will be rewarded for going out of the beaten track, and
that in Brittany, owing to the wonderful durability of the Kersanton
stone, we can still see the handwork and judge of the skill of the
sculptors of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class='c000'>The church of Le Folgoet stands, as guide-books tell us, on “a
silent spot, unvisited save on certain festivals, and removed a mile
and a half from any town.” We find it the centre of a tumult
impossible to describe. There is a large horse-fair being held, which
has collected a crowd almost equal to that at Carhaix; but here
there is more variety in the costume of the men, the red Phrygian
caps and sashes lighting up the crowd with unusual colour. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>scene strangely in contrast with the quiet of the cathedral, where
under its cool arcades men are kneeling, whip in hand; they have
come to pray for a special blessing from St. Cornély, the patron saint
of cattle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men, in light canvas trousers and blue jerseys, standing on
the left in the picture of the fair, are horse dealers and agents for
the government, who attend every cattle fair and market throughout
the country. The men on the right, watching a horse being trotted
out, are thoroughly characteristic figures, portraits of well-to-do Breton
farmers and dealers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy on the horse is a good example of the Breton <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</span></i>,
or hanger-on at fairs, who trots out the horses with untiring energy,
and with a freedom and grace of limb delightful to behold.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>At Landerneau we are once more on the
high-road to Brest. We have left for a
time the dreary wind-blown promontories of
the coast, and find shelter in a pleasant valley,
surrounded by trees and gardens, and watered
by a river which opens out westward into the
bay of Brest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The railway from Landerneau to Brest is
carried for the most part at a high level, and
from the windows on the <em>left hand</em> we obtain
beautiful views of the scenery of the bay.
Below we can see the stores of timber for naval use, and are otherwise
reminded of our approach to a sea-port by the company which
collect at the small stations <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</span></i>. In the crowded carriage are
old weather-beaten fishermen and countrywomen with market
baskets, and, in one corner, two boys with fair fresh faces, set in
wide straw hats, bearing upon them the inscriptions of <em>Vulcan</em> and
<em>Vengeance</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brest is a naval station of such importance that even travellers in
search of the picturesque should not pass it by without a short visit;
the arsenal, docks, and harbour are on a scale of completeness
second only to Cherbourg; moreover, Brest is the most convenient
point from which to visit other parts of the coast of Finistère, especially
the fishing village of Le Conquet, the abbey of St. Mathieu on the
extreme western point of Brittany, and the island of Ouëssant. Brest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>is situated on an elevated position on the north side of one of the
finest natural harbours in the world, commanding good views from its
ramparts and promenades. The population is about 70,000, exclusive
of soldiers and sailors; a busy cosmopolitan maritime city, in which
there is little of the Breton character to be studied.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus066_smmap.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In order to realise the beauty of the inland bay of Brest, we must
look down again from our imaginary <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ballon captif</span></i>, and see its blue
waters, green banks and woods coming down to the water’s edge; the
country dotted with white villas
and little wooden châlets belonging
to the wealthy traders of Brest,
and here and there the sombre
avenues of a château with grey,
high-pitched roofs and pointed
turrets peeping through the trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Across this inland sea, traversed
by little steamers and dotted with
white sails—raised high upon the
heath-clad hills which form the western spur of the Monts d’Arrée—is
the little town of Plougastel.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is too late to cross the bay on the occasion of our visit to
Plougastel, and so we take the last train to Kerhuon station, where
there is a ferry. A vessel has just been paid off at Brest, and in the
railway carriage are several sailors on their way home. One of them
gets out with us at Kerhuon, and we go down together to the river.
By some mischance the ferry-boat is missing, and all is darkness at
the little boathouse. The young sailor, ready at expedients, puts down
his pack, collects some furze, and lights a fire as a signal. We sit and
wait and shout at intervals, burning the fuel until just about midnight,
when we hear the plash of oars, and a dark object glides past; it is
a fishing-boat with one mast, with three men in the stern, and two
women rowing. After a little parleying they agree to take us across
for thirty centimes each, and the women turn the boat round, running
it heavily against the stones of the causeway. We get in quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and stand in the bows, whilst we silently cross the Landerneau
river. It is a strange, mysterious boat-load; not a word is uttered,
there is no sound but the heavy plodding and working of the
oars, and the night is so dark we cannot see the faces of the men
or the nature of the packages that weigh down the stern. The
moon, rising through the clouds, just illumines the darkness as we
near the shore; it shines on the smooth, wet mast, on the waterproof
hat of the marine standing up in the boat, and reveals close
to us the strong, stout arms of a girl, bared to the shoulder, her
head concealed in a dark, tight-fitting headdress, with lappets like
an Egyptian sphynx; the head is raised for a moment, and eyes are
turned upon us as we leave, but no word is uttered, scarcely a
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon soir!</span>” as the boat drifts away into the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The moon shines as we ascend the hill—winding up a path between
great rocks and under the shadow of stunted trees, to Plougastel—revealing
a poor-looking town of plain stone houses, silent and
deserted at this midnight hour. At a corner of two streets our
companion points out the inn and takes leave, having to go to his
home at the further end of the town. We knock for admittance,
but without avail; heads are put out of various windows, but the
answer is that every house is crowded, for “to-morrow is the fête”;
and, truth to tell, curses are heaped upon the strangers for disturbing
the dogs, who begin to howl as they trot by on their midnight errands.
There is nothing to be done until daybreak, and so the night is spent
in the open air.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have come to Plougastel to see the people, and also its famous
calvary, which stands in the middle of a desolate churchyard strewn
with newly cut stone. As the day begins to dawn, we make our way
to the church, and to the spot where we can just discern the calvary,
with its carved figures standing darkly against the sky. There is a
flutter at our approach, for birds have been nestling behind the
headless horsemen, and sheltering in the nooks and corners of the
ancient pile. We leave them to silence a little longer, and stroll out
to the highest ground to see the sun rise. Soon there is a streak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>light from the east, which gives shape and outline to the church
tower and the grey roofs of Plougastel, and, as we reach the high
ground outside the town, the landscape southward is lighting in the
morning sun; we see cultivated valleys and parklike views, with
pleasant green slopes leading down to the sea. But beautiful as is
the foreground, with its undulating green, interspersed with granite
boulders, with dew upon gossamer webs and little clouds of vapour
stealing between clumps of grass, the view across the bay, where the
distant headlands (indicated on the map overleaf) take a pearly
tinge, is the best sight of all. A little northward and westward are
the masts, chimneys, and church spires, and the smoke and steam,
of Brest, for the morning is breaking over a busy scene at the arsenal
and dockyards; but here, as the sun shines out, the sound in the
long grass are of grasshoppers, birds, and bees.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the morning of the fête; the thrush clears his throat, and
so do the peasants in their own way, as they come slowly up the
hill. Let us leave the view and go into the streets of Plougastel,
which are already alive with people, some of whom might be the
descendants of Eastern races, wearing Egyptian or Phrygian headdresses,
caps from Albania, embroideries from Greece, and sashes from
Arabia. Here, then, for the first time in our travels, we find colour
predominating in the costumes of the people. Some of the women
wear close-fitting dark green caps embroidered with gold thread, their
dark skirts also bordered with embroideries or stripes of colour; some
wear white stockings and neat-fitting, red or black, slippers or shoes.
But the prevailing headdress of the women is the white cambric <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffe</span></i>
with large side lappets and wide collars which we see elsewhere in
Finistère; the men have broad-brimmed hats with embroidered
strings or ribbons. Some of the men who come from the south
wear striped trousers with a red sash, and spare blue jacket with
numerous silver buttons, as in the sketch opposite. Some are dressed
entirely in blue cloth or serge, with sashes and red caps, but others
have broad white trousers and belts, their jackets and blouses
embroidered on the shoulders and sleeves. There is colour everywhere,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>subdued by the dark blue of blouses and the sober brown and green
stuff gowns of the older women.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is said that the people of Plougastel, preserving their old costumes
and traditions, still live much apart from their neighbours; a life half
seafaring, half agricultural, whose origin is traced to some early immigration
of Eastern races. By ten o’clock hundreds of people have come
in from the neighbouring villages, and as they all crowd together at
the church door and in the square round the calvary, we see the
strangest medley of costumes in all Brittany. They collect round the
calvary, some praying, some quarrelling or bargaining for small wares;
a general place of rendezvous on fête-days, especially on the 24th of
June (the Feast of St. Jean, called the “Pardon of Birds”), when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>a large number of birds are offered for sale. This is a good day to
see the costumes of the peasants, to hear their songs, and to see the
dances in the streets of Plougastel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The calvary was erected about the year 1602, and some of the
figures are as sharp and clear as if carved yesterday; some are headless,
and otherwise injured or destroyed. Around the three elevated
crosses are a series of bas-reliefs, full-length figures cut in Kersanton
stone, depicting various incidents in New Testament history—the Entry
into Jerusalem, Christ teaching among the Doctors, the Offerings of
the Magi, the Baptism of St. John, the Entombment, &amp;c. On the
south side is a representation of the Bearing of the Cross, on the
north is the Judgment of Pilate, and so on. Some of the figures
are very expressive, some have a certain quaintness and humour, and
here and there we detect the same anachronisms in costume as at
St. Thégonnec, where the Breton costume is introduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Altogether we must regard the calvary of Plougastel as a curiosity
rather than as a great work of art; a grotesque group which, in its
dark rugged outline set against the sky, will be remembered by
travellers as something peculiar to Brittany, something which, in this
land of strange mediæval monuments and relics, is yet perhaps the
strangest sight of all.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Returning to Daoulas, we join the high-road between Landerneau
and Quimper, and pass southwards along the inland shores of the
bay of Brest to Châteaulin. As travellers speed through this district
by railway, they get glimpses, on the left hand, of the forest of
Guimerch, and on the right, through the tree-tops, of inlets of the
bay, and of the ancient little town of Le Faou, lying as it were
at their feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the railway we pass over an estuary at a great elevation,
and on a greater part of the route to Châteaulin are on the spurs
of the Monts d’Arrée. Travellers from Brest to Quimper should not
be deterred from stopping at Châteaulin by the one line devoted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>it in guide-books, viz. “a dirty little town in parklike scenery, with no
good inns.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus068.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The shores of the bay of Brest and the bay of Douarnenez
are districts to be lingered in when the sun shines, for the days
are really few when we may see the country to advantage. The
luxuriance of foliage on the hills, the height of the grasses, the
deep green in the valleys, and the enormous umbrellas carried
by the peasants, should remind us that fine days are few.</p>

<p class='c000'>Châteaulin is crowded once a year to visit the Pardon of Ste.
Anne la Palue, a ceremony that generally takes place on the last
Sunday in August. The modern chapel of Ste. Anne stands alone
upon high ground, overlooking the bay of Douarnenez, near Plonévez-Porsay,
a small village about eight miles west of Châteaulin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Crowds of people come from Brest by boat, and every road and
pathway leading to the chapel is lined with people on the morning
of the Pardon. The ceremonies are nearly the same as at Guingamp
and at Ste. Anne d’Auray, but the camping-out of the people on
the hillside above the sea (sometimes 10,000 in number), the processions
of pilgrims, bare-footed, to the Holy Well of Ste. Anne, and
other customs, are more curious than any to be seen elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is at the Pardon of Ste. Anne la Palue that the ceremonies of
the church are rendered most picturesque from the surroundings, and
where a greater variety of the ancient costumes of Cornouaille are to
be seen. The trinkets, rosaries, and ribbons which are blessed and
sold to the peasants are a modern importation from Angers or
Lyons, but the embroidery round the dress of a beggar woman
may be rare in colour and design. Nowhere else, excepting at Plougastel,
shall we see such embroidered caps and bodices; nowhere, not
even at Auray, such bronzed and wrinkled human creatures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The procession of the priests and people takes place on Saturday,
about three in the afternoon, when the banner of Ste. Anne la
Palue is carried across the hills by girls dressed in crimson, gold-embroidered
robes, with scarves of silver thread and headdresses of lace
and tissue of gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are pictures in sunshine which are rare at Pardon times,
and of summer nights when camping under tents is no hardship; but
what must the scene be at Ste. Anne la Palue in storm and rain, when
thousands of pilgrims, old and young, have no shelter, when all colour
and brightness has vanished, and the wind sweeps over the hills?</p>

<p class='c000'>Let us now turn inland a few miles, following the course of the
Canal de Brest, to Châteauneuf du Faou, a small town where Mr.
Caldecott made sketches at a Pardon which was held in the rain.
This visit, made in 1874, will be best described in the artist’s own
words:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The courier for Châteauneuf du Faou left Châteaulin at 3 <span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.M.</span></span>
So we hire a phaeton, and proceed up the hilly road towards Pleyben.
On the left is a beautiful vale with a pretty village by the side of
the river which runs towards Brest. The scenery is like the borders
of Wales, and the weather like that of Scotland; but the clean, elderly
girls coming down the road are like themselves only.</p>

<img src='images/illus070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>“We reach Pleyben in about two hours, a small deserted-looking
town with a wide <em>Place</em>, at one end of which is a curious calvary
(date 1670) undergoing repair, and an old church, partly Gothic,
partly Renaissance. The painted window over the altar is apparently
old, but part is replaced by plain glass. The ceiling is blue with gold
stars, and there are large painted effigies of the apostles in the porch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In about two hours after leaving Pleyben, the phaeton rattles
into the little town of Châteauneuf du Faou, knocking about the
umbrellas of the people crowding the streets on the occasion of a
pardon. The Hôtel du Midi, where we put up, is at the farther end
of the town, and is conducted in a simple manner. Ladies would not
like its arrangements. Several inhabitants, and a visitor or two, dine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>at the table d’hôte, but all are unable to carve a duck except the
English visitor, who is accordingly put down as a cook. There is music
in the streets, and the town is full of people, some of whom dance
a kind of quadrille, called the ‘gavotte,’ in the market-hall; others
attend a large booth to see acrobatic and other performances.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“The next day is still wet, and there are many people again in the
streets, some from far away. The races come off on the high-road. I go
to see the finish of one; four horses,
strong and about fourteen hands
high, gallop up a hilly length of a
high-road; a pink, a red, a yellow,
and a green and white jacket, dash
by with a flourish of gaily tied up
tails. I join the admiring crowd
which encircles the winner, and we
all go in procession to the Hôtel de
Ville. I notice as the rider dismounts
and enters the building to
receive the prize (twenty francs) that
he uses no saddle, wears his usual
trousers, and has his coloured cap
and jacket made of calico.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the large timber-built market-hall
is a vast crowd of extensively
linened, many-buttoned men—some
with rosettes, the stewards of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span>—joined hand in hand in one
long serpentine line with clean, red-faced,
large-capped, big-collared girls.
They jig along the earthen floor in
shoes, clogs, and sabots to the music
of a flageolet and a bag-pipe, varied
by an occasional few bars of the voice. This is called the ‘gavotte,’
as the waitress of the hôtel, who is dancing, informs me. A farmer
in blouse, with a collar (sketched overleaf), beats time with his sabots.
One soldier, two town bonnets, and a few gendarmes relieve the costume
of the peasants, which is, however, full of variety.”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus073.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Breton <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ronde</span></i> or round dance, of which the gavotte is a good
example, is one of the most characteristic scenes to be witnessed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Brittany. At nearly every fête and gathering—in the streets, in the
fields, or in the town-hall—we see the peasants dancing the gavotte,
the musicians being generally two, one with the ancient Armorican
bag-pipe (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biniou</span></i>), the other with a flageolet. Frequently, as in the
sketch, one of the musicians puts down his instrument to sing.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The dancers keep good time, going through a variety of figures,
but always returning to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ronde</span></i>, dancing together, hand in hand,
with great precision and animation, and a certain kind of grace. The
gravity of manner and the downward look of the women in certain
figures, as they advance and retire with hands down, give a peculiar
quaintness to the gavotte, which, apparently rollicking and unrestrained,
is, in fact, orderly and regular in every movement. The circular
motion of the dancers, now revolving in several circles, now in one
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande ronde</span></i>, is traced by M. Emile Souvestre, and other writers, to
Druidic origin and the movements of the stars.</p>

<div id='Gavotte'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus075.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>But as the dancers come swinging
down the centre of the hall, hand in
hand, now meeting, now parting; as fresh
couples join and others fall into the rear;
as we hear the measured tread and the
voices which never seem to tire, we should
be content to describe the “gavotte” as
a good old country dance of singular
animation and picturesqueness; a scene
of jollity and at the same time of good
order, of which the sketch gives an admirable
idea.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus076.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is one figure dressed in the latest
fashion of Quimper, who is looked upon
with doubtful admiration by the other
dancers, but who will serve to remind us
that distinctive costume, even in these out-of-the-way
places, is a flickering flame, and
that in a few years such scenes as the
above will have lost their character.</p>

<p class='c000'>We give a few bars of a favourite air, played with great spirit,
which seemed to give the performers intense enjoyment, for they
returned to it again and again.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/music.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>At dusk oil lamps are lighted, a crowd fills the hall, and, when far
away down the wet streets of Châteauneuf du Faou, we can see the
steam rising between the rafters and hear the clatter of the dancers.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus077.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Four years later, on the 8th of August 1878, we arrive on a quiet,
sultry evening at the same little inn at Châteauneuf. There is no
one in the house but two little children and some fowls, and the streets
are silent and almost deserted; but at a little distance from the inn
we hear the heavy thud of flails, and going up a little green pathway
across the road, where a grey cloud of dust rises between the trees,
we come upon a scene of energy and determination which defies
description. It is the last evening for threshing out a little patch of
corn, and the whole strength of the establishment has been enlisted
in the service, including the waiter, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef de cuisine</span></i>, stable-boy, a farm
labourer, and one or two professional “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batteurs</span>”; four on one side, five
on the other, swinging and letting fall their heavy flails in turn, close
to each others’ heads, with a precision and desperate energy wonderful
to behold. Mr. Caldecott’s sketches, taken at the moment, in a cloud
of dust, bring the scene before us most vividly; the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçon</span></i> of the inn,
the second in the row, all energy and excitement, putting his face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>into his work so to speak, urging on the rest by shouts and gestures,
but still keeping steady time with his flail; opposite to him, last but
one, is “Madame,” her face tied tightly over with a veil, as a protection
from the dust; and, last in the line, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef de cuisine</span></i>, working as
hard as the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the second sketch the leaders have changed position, the pace
is quickened, and, from where we stand, the flails seem to fly dangerously
close to the heads of the women. But no one flinches, and the strokes
come down together as if from two operators instead of nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The grain is beaten out wastefully on the ground, and gathered into
sacks by two old women, who put the straw afterwards into the pillows
of the Hôtel du Midi.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>In the fruitful valley of the Odet
and the Steir, where two rivers
join in their southern course to the
sea, there rise the beautiful spires of
Quimper, the present capital of Finistère;
a town containing about 13,000 inhabitants,
now the centre of the commerce
and industry of southern Finistère, and,
it may be added, the most pleasant
resting-place on our travels. If we
approach Quimper for the first time
by road over the hills, we shall form
the best idea of the beauty of its situation
and of the picturesqueness of its
buildings. The first impression of the traveller who arrives by train,
and is hurried in an omnibus along the straight quays lined with
trees, to the Hôtel de l’Épée, on the right bank of the river Odet, is
one of slight disappointment at the modern aspect of the town; but
let him glance for one moment from above out of one of the back
windows of the inn (opened for him by the bright-faced maiden
sketched on page <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>), and the view of old roofs and cathedral
towers will reassure his mind that neither in architecture nor in costume
is this city likely to be wanting in interest. Quimper, the ancient capital
of Cornouaille, with its warlike and romantic history of the middle ages,
the centre of historic associations in the times of the War of the Succession,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>preserves many landmarks and monuments that will interest the
traveller and the antiquarian. The fine Gothic cathedral has a richly
sculptured porch with foliated carving of the fourteenth century, such
as we saw at Le Folgoet. Above and between the two towers is an
equestrian statue of the somewhat mythical King Gradlon, who held
a court at Kemper in the fifth century, whose prowess is recorded
in the early chronicles of Brittany, and in the romances of the Round
Table. The episode of his hunting in the neighbouring forests, being
miraculously fed by one Corentin, a hermit, and finally converted to
Christianity, is recorded continually in song and story; and from
this incident (related by Souvestre and sung by Brizeux) dates the
foundation of the ancient bishopric of St. Corentin. The statue, like
nearly every monument in Brittany, was partly destroyed during the
Revolution in 1793.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In spite of railways, telegraphs, and newspapers, and the bustle of
commerce that fills the streets and market of Quimper, some of the
inhabitants of the neighbouring valleys find time, on St. Cecilia’s Day,
to perform a pilgrimage to the cathedral and to sing songs in honour
of St. Corentin. Thus we see how lovingly conservative Brittany
clings to its monuments and legends, and how its people still dwell
in the past. The story of King Gradlon may be a myth, but, like
all legends and traditions, it has its origin in fact; and we who are
not historians may be fascinated with the thought that the battered
horseman, the object of so much
interest to pilgrims in the past and
to tourists in the present, is a link
in a chain of facts, pointing backwards
to a far-off time when, a little
westward of the site of the present
city of Quimper, on a promontory
near Pont Croix, stood the ancient
Celtic city of Is, remains of which
are to be found to this day upon the
shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cathedral of Quimper was
founded in the thirteenth century,
but was principally built in the fourteenth
and fifteenth. It has no
very remarkable architectural features, but there is a grandeur in the
lofty aspect of the interior, lighted by some fine stained glass, which
leaves an impression of beauty on the mind. It is the centre and
rallying-point for all the country round, the home of Catholicism, the
“one church” to the inhabitants of Finistère. No picture of the
wide <em>Place</em> by the river, where the great gatherings take place on fête-days,
and where so many curious costumes are to be seen together,
is complete without the two modern spires of the cathedral rearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>high above the town. The procession of people passing up the wide
street on a Sunday morning leading to its doors—a dense mass of
figures, fringed with white caps, like foam on a heaving sea,
the figures framed by projecting gables nearly meeting overhead—forms
another picture which has also for its background the two
noble spires.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The old houses in the market-place in the cathedral
square, and the old inn, the Hôtel du Lion d’Or (this last well
worthy of a sketch), are overshadowed by the pile. The people that
come in by the old-fashioned diligences and the country carts and
waggons go straight to the cathedral on arrival in the square.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We believe it was to M. Viollet Le Duc, whose architectural taste and energy are so
well known in France, that the completion of these towers is principally due.</p>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The interior of the cathedral, which is the largest in Brittany,
is very striking; there is a handsome chapel dedicated to Ste. Anne,
the patron saint of Brittany, to St. Roch, and other saints. There
is high-mass at half past ten, and a sermon by an ancient ecclesiastic
preached from the handsome carved pulpit in the nave. It is an
eloquent discourse, apparently, for along the aisles and between the
pillars familiar-sounding phrases are poured fluent and fast. But
the dense crowd of men and women with upturned faces on the
pavement near the door can hear little of what is passing; the words
take an upward curve of sound, and are heard more distinctly
by the spiders and the flies. The loss may not have been great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>if we take the testimony of a writer<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> in 1877, who says:—“I attended
mass one morning at Quimper, and the following is the substance
of a sermon preached to a large and attentive congregation mostly
of working men and women: ‘There are three duties,’ said the
preacher, ‘imposed by the church on the faithful: first, to confess
at least once a year; secondly, to confess in one’s own parish; thirdly,
to confess within the fifteen days of Easter.’ The omission of the first
of these is regarded by the church as a sin of such gravity that
it is condemned to be punished by
the withholding of Christian burial.
Not one word, throughout a long
discourse to simple, devout, careworn
peasant folk, of moral teaching, religious
counsel, or brotherly love!”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><cite>A Year in Western France</cite>, by M. Betham-Edwards.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In some of the chapels there are
services during the day, and there is
a continual movement of white caps
in and out of the confessionals; and,
occasionally during the day, some
poor, weather-worn man is doing
penance, going round and round the
cathedral on his knees, making a
curious slouching sound on the pavement
(as grotesque a figure as
sketched on page <a href='#Page_106'>106</a>). He is dressed in rags, and carries his sabots
under his arm during his long journey; thus, several times round the
pavement, dragging his weary limbs and—according to the enormity
of his sins—paying his sous as he goes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The character of the people of this part of Cornouaille seems less
reserved, and there is a gay, genial aspect about them which is
refreshing when coming from the north. The bright face and figure
of the girl whose portrait Mr. Caldecott has caught exactly is one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of a flutter of five, who wait at table at the Hôtel de l’Épée in the
costume of the country, which, by the way, is worn here for the
especial benefit of travellers. It is probable that every one of these
bright-faced women would discard it to-morrow if they had the
chance (as their mistress and her children have done); but there is still
plenty of local costume to be seen in Quimper. We have only to
go out into the gardens, to visit the farms, by-roads, and lanes, and we
shall come upon some of the most picturesque scenes in our travels.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In the corner of a field just outside the town, where a lively
discussion is going forward between a farm labourer and three girls
at a well, there is a picture which for colour alone is worth remembering.
It is one of those everyday scenes in which costume and
the surrounding landscape harmonise delightfully. We give few
sketches of architecture because photographs of the best examples
may always be obtained, preferring rather to give the life of the
people. There are more figure subjects in the streets of Quimper
than there is time to note. Thus, for instance, as we pass through
a poor, dirty suburb at the lower end of the town, a woman comes
to the door of a dark dwelling, and gives alms to a professional
beggar, so grotesque and terrible in aspect that he hardly seems
human; but the woman standing at the stone doorway wears a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>costume that might have been copied from an Elizabethan missal.
She gives, as every one gives, to the poor in Brittany, but her
husband’s small wages at the pottery works hard by leave little
margin for charity, and he will want all his spare money at this
time of year for the fêtes. The fêtes are an occasion for universal
feasting and rejoicing, in which the drinking propensities of the
holiday makers are only too apparent in the streets, leading in the
evening, sometimes, to domestic interviews like the one sketched
below.<a id='t107'></a></p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus086.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>At the time of the Fête of the Assumption there is a crowd at
Quimper from all parts of Finistère, and there is an amount of
festivity which must be bewildering to the quiet inhabitants; it is
then that we may see sometimes in the streets the splendid type
of Breton woman sketched at the head of this chapter, and, by
contrast, some others much more grotesque.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>But perhaps the most interesting group of all, and the most
complete and characteristic of Mr. Caldecott’s sketches, is the one which
forms the frontispiece to this volume—a scene in a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabaret</span></i>, or wineshop,
where the farmers who have come in to market, whose carts
we may see on the cathedral square, meet and discuss the topics of
the day, amongst which, after the state of trade and the crops,
the term of Marshal McMahon’s government and the results of
the annual levy of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les conscrits</span>” are
uppermost. Soon after harvest-time, generally
early in September, the annual levy
of reserves for the army takes place,
and Quimper, being the centre of a
populous district, is the rallying-point for
lower Finistère.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus087.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is the nearest approach to an open
political discussion that we may witness
on our travels, and a good opportunity
to see the conservative Breton farmer, the
“owner of the soil,” one who troubles himself little about “politics”
in the true sense of the word, and is scarcely a match in argument
for the more advanced republican trader and manufacturer of Quimper,
but who, from hereditary instinct, if from no other motive, is generally
an upholder of legitimist doctrines and a royalist at heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seated on the carved oak bench on the left is a young Breton
clodhopper or farm help, whose ill-luck it has been to be drawn this
year; who leaves his farm with regret—a home where he worked
from sunrise to sunset for two francs a week, living on coarse food
and lodging in the dark with the pigs. As he sits and listens with
perplexed attention to the principal speaker, and others gather round
in the common room to hear the oracle, we have a picture which
tells its story with singular eloquence, and presents to us the common
everyday life of the people of lower Brittany with a truthfulness
and vivacity seldom, if ever, exceeded. The only bright colour in
the picture is in the red sashes of the men and in one or two small
ornaments worn by the women.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
<img src='images/illus088.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Other scenes should be recorded if only to show, by way of
contrast, that Quimper is very like other parts of France. At one
of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lycées</span></i> the annual prize-giving is going forward, and there is
a fashionable gathering, in which military uniforms are prominent. It
is an opportunity for seeing some of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span></i> of Quimper both on the
platform and in the crowded hall, and a great chance for a sketch.
The boys come up one by one, and stand on a raised platform to be
decorated with a paper wreath, to receive a book and a salutation on
both cheeks. It is interesting to note that, before joining his applauding
friends in the hall, the boy takes off his wreath and throws it
away. There is scarcely a Breton costume in the hall.</p>
<div  class='figleft id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>
<img src='images/illus089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In Quimper we are in a pleasant valley, surrounded by gardens,
orchards, and fields, and sheltered from the wind by clustering woods.
The sun shines so warmly here
that it is difficult to realise that
a few miles to the west and
south there are stretches of
broad moorland leading to the
boldest coast on the west of
France. It is true that the
people that come in from Pont
l’Abbé, Audierne, and Douarnenez
bear the impress of a
seafaring life, and are different in style and costume to any that we
have yet seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is worth while for every one who stays in Quimper to see
something of the coast, and to make a tour of at least two or three
days to Pont l’Abbé, Penmarc’h, Pont Croix, the Pointe du Raz, and
Douarnenez. In this short journey the traveller will see some of the
finest coast scenery in Brittany, and people differing in character
and costume from other parts of Finistère; a hardy fishing population,
tempted to dangers and hardships by the riches to be found in
the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the scenery which we have passed through on our way to
Quimper resembled Wales, the district west of Quimper will remind
us of Cornwall. We are, in fact, on the extreme edge of Brittany,
corresponding to the Cornwall of England, <em>Cornouaille</em>, the <em>Cornn
Galliæ</em> of the ancients, a dangerous, storm-blown coast, wild, desolate,
and picturesque. We may go down the river from Quimper to Pont
l’Abbé, or a shorter route by road a distance of twelve miles, the
first part over hills and through cultivated lands, in the latter part
over wide moorland, covered with gorse and edged with pines. This
is a beautiful drive, but, to judge of the quiet, almost mediæval
stillness of Pont l’Abbé, it should be approached by water on a
summer’s evening, when, after a long and sometimes rather boisterous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>passage from the mouth of the river Odet, the little fishing-boat is
rowed up the Pont l’Abbé river under the tower of its ancient castle.
On the left, before entering the river, the little port of Loctudy is
passed, where there is an ancient Romanesque church, well preserved,
said to have been built by the Knights Templars in the twelfth century.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus090.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Pont l’Abbé with its dull, straight streets and deserted-looking
houses, has no striking architectural features; but the costumes of
the people are altogether unique in Brittany, and the interiors of their
dwellings are as quaint and curious as any painter would desire. The
women wear close-fitting caps of red or green, embroidered with gold
thread, the hair being turned up at the back and fastened at the top;
they wear skirts of blue or green with a border of yellow, and the
men, short blue jackets and sashes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Pont l’Abbé we may see, what is so rare in these days, an old
street in which the costume of the people harmonises with the date
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of the buildings, and in which the quiet of a past century seems never
to have been disturbed. Walk down a narrow grass-grown street to
the open square above the river, at the end of which is the western
porch of the fine church of Pont l’Abbé, and the only two figures
visible in the afternoon are a girl carrying a basket coming from the
Carmelite convent, and a priest in black robes crossing the square.
The church and convent were founded in 1383, and there is little here
to mark the passage of years. The church has been completed and
beautified since those early times, and afterwards wrecked by the
Revolution; but the aspect of the square and of the cloisters of the
convent are little altered. The interior of the church is remarkable
for the grace and lightness of its pillars, and for the richness of its
stained glass; the rose windows are said to rival in beauty those
of Rouen. Notwithstanding that the church has but one aisle, that
the ceiling is now painted blue, and that the carvings in stone and
wood are sadly mutilated, it is an architectural monument of great
interest.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus091.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Six miles south-west of Pont l’Abbé, across a dreary, marshy
plain is the poor fishing town of Penmarc’h, built upon the dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>rocks that form a barrier against the sea, on one of the wildest
promontories of Cornouaille; a city whose riches in the fifteenth
century were so great that, according to historians, “she could equip her
three thousand men-at-arms, and shelter behind her jetties a fleet of
eight hundred craft.” The original prosperity of Penmarc’h arose from
the cod-fisheries, which were the source of immense wealth before the
discovery of Newfoundland. The history of its invasion by the English
in 1404, and the disasters in the sixteenth century, when the town
was partly destroyed by an inroad of the sea, and afterwards sacked
by Guy Eder Fontenelle at the time of the Wars of the League, is
one of the most romantic and terrible in the history of Brittany. It
is a place to see if only to mark the traces of this wonderful city, once
containing 10,000 inhabitants. A few ruined towers and the foundations
of streets mark the site of the ancient city, which is now inhabited
by a scattered fishing population numbering in all about 2000, the men
braving the elements in their little fishing-boats, the women and children
collecting seaweed and tilling the poor soil. There is a mass of rocks
separated from the land, called the Torche de Penmarc’h, which all
visitors are taken to see, and where the waves break upon the shore
with the sound of thunder.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have said little of the ruins of the church of St. Guénolé and
of the parish church of Ste. Nonna at Penmarc’h, with its stained
glass and quaint stone carving, or of other relics of the ancient city,
because in nearly every town in Cornouaille there is some object of
interest to examine. Antiquarian travellers should stay at the Hôtel
des Voyageurs at Pont l’Abbé, where they will be very comfortably
housed, and can explore this district, interesting not only for the
historic associations connected with Penmarc’h, but for Druidical
remains which the winds of the Atlantic are laying bare every year
on this coast. It is a dreary, wind-swept promontory, from which the
quiet superstitious inhabitants are only too glad to retreat. No
wonder they flock into Quimper, and sun themselves on the <em>Place</em>
during the summer days!</p>

<p class='c000'>On the road between Pont l’Abbé and Audierne we obtain fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>views of the open landscape, with solitary figures here and there
working in the fields, and occasional glimpses of the sea. It is a
windy drive; the colour is sombre, and the clouds which come up in
heavy masses from the sea cast deep shadows over the land.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus092.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>If we try to recall the impression of the scene, it is principally
of clouds, as in landscapes by Ruysdael or Géricault. The land for
miles is without sign of habitation, the highest point of interest is a
bank of furze, a stunted tree, or a heap of broken stones, chipped
perhaps from a fallen menhir; a solitude that seems more hopeless
and remote from the tumultuous aspect of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as we approach the town of Pont Croix, and, turning westward,
descend the hills to cross the estuary of Audierne, the view over the
bay is more luxuriant. Below us, through the stems of pine trees
that line the steep road, cut in granite rocks—as we descend to the
right bank of the river Goayen where it widens into an estuary—is
the little fishing village of Audierne, consisting of two or three straight
streets of granite houses, one or two large wharves and warehouses, a
lighthouse, and nearly a mile of protecting sea-wall. The evening is
now fine and calm, and the tide is coming in without a ripple, bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>a few fishing-boats up to the quay, and attracting the inhabitants
on to the <em>Place</em> in front of the principal inn, the Hôtel du Commerce,
where the portly Père Batifoulier receives us, and provides us with
excellent accommodation. It is a sheltered, sunny spot, surrounded
by cultivated hills, where people come from Quimper to bathe in
summer; but if we walk upon the downs behind the town, we shall
get glimpses of a coast almost as exposed and dangerous to mariners
as at Penmarc’h, where the sardine fishermen are spreading their nets
on the grass.</p>

<p class='c000'>Audierne is within six miles of the famous Pointe du Raz, the
Land’s End of Brittany, beyond which, stretching out into the Atlantic,
is the Île de Sein, inhabited by a poor population of fishermen
and seaweed gatherers. A glance at the map will show the position
of the island, and the “Bec du Raz,” the dangerous channel which
divides it from the shore, through which the fishermen of Audierne
and Douarnenez, with many prayers and crossings of the breast,
pass and re-pass in their frail boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a dreary road from Audierne to the Pointe du Raz, passing
the villages of Plogoff and Lescoff. At this point the rocks are
higher above the sea than at Penmarc’h, and the scene is altogether
more extensive and magnificent. We are on an elevation of eighty
or ninety feet, and almost surrounded by the sea. To the south and
east is the wide bay of Audierne, to the west the Île de Sein, the
ancient home of Druidesses, and the horizon line of the Atlantic;
to the north and east the bay of Douarnenez, across which is the
jutting headland of La Chèvre.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cloud of sea-birds rises from the rocks below, and floats away
like a puff of steam, there is an orange tint in the seaweed piled
upon the shore, and a purple tinge upon the distant hills across the
bay of Douarnenez; but the green upon the scanty grass in the
foreground is cold in colour, and almost the only flowers are yellow
sea-poppies and the little white bells of the convolvulus. On every side
are piles of rocks stretching out seaward as barriers against the waves
of the Atlantic; a dangerous, desolate shore, on which many a vessel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>has been wrecked. To the north is the Druids’ “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baie des Trépassés</span>,”
where, according to ancient legends, the spirits of the departed wait
on the shore to be taken in boats to the Île de Sein. It is a Celtic
legend, recounted in every history of Brittany.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/illus093.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The exposed position of the Pointe du Raz, the strange, fantastic
grandeur of the rocks, and the wildness of the waves that beat upon
the shore in almost all weathers, are alone worth a visit. The
numerous artists who stay at Quimper, Douarnenez, and Pont-Aven,
in the summer months would do well to pitch their tents for a time
near the Pointe du Raz, if only to watch from this elevation the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>changing aspects of sea and sky, to see the sea, calm and blue in
the distance, but dashing spray in sunshine over walls of rock, and
seaweed gatherers on a summer evening getting in their harvest, as
deep in colour as the corn.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus095.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Leaving Audierne, and turning eastward towards Douarnenez,
following the course of the river Goayen, we come in about an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>hour to Pont Croix, an ancient town of 2500 inhabitants. The
church is a fine Romanesque building of the fifteenth century,
with a curious porch and some good carving in the interior. It is
a quiet, rather deserted-looking town, on an eminence above the
river, reminding one in its position and its air of faded importance
of the ecclesiastical city of Coutances, in Normandy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus096.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a fine drive over undulating hills to Douarnenez, with views
of landscape more fertile than any we have seen since leaving Quimper;
landscape with open moorland, interspersed with fields of corn, where
harvesting is being actively carried on, as in the sketch. Here we get a
glimpse of one of the old farmhouses of Finistère, and (on a very small
scale) of the farmer himself approaching in the distance to superintend
operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few miles farther, and the landscape is again bare and uncultivated,
we see peasants in the fields at rare intervals; flocks of black
and brown sheep feeding on the open land. There is a charm of
wildness and a peculiar beauty about the scenery here that we who
write for artists should insist upon with all the power of the pen. It
is the fashion to stay at Douarnenez and at Pont-Aven, but we have
few records of the best scenery in Cornouaille.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Douarnenez, the headquarters of the sardine-fisheries, has a
population of about 9000, almost entirely given up to this industry;
the men in their boats, and the women and girls in the factories.
It is a busy, dirty, and not very attractive town, with one principal
street leading down to the port; but walk out of it in any direction,
so as to escape the odours of the sardine factories, and the views
from the high ground are most rewarding.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is no prettier sight, for instance, than to watch the arrival of
a fleet of several hundred fishing-boats rounding the last promontory,
racing in whilst they are eagerly watched from the shore. At the
point where the sketch was taken, the little fleet divides, to come to
anchor at different inlets of the bay. Of the scene down at the
port, where the boats unload; of the massing of a forest of masts
against the evening sky, with rocks and houses high above as a
background, we can only hint in these pages.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>At Douarnenez, in summer, the inhabitants are accustomed to
an inroad of visitors who come for the bathing season, and there is
a little colony of artists who live comfortably at the principal inns
(<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en pension</span></i> for five or six francs a day), but it is not as quiet as
Pont-Aven, of which we shall speak in the next chapter, for the streets
are closely built and badly paved, and the busy inhabitants wear
sabots which are rattled down to the shore at all hours of the day
and night, according to the tide. Moreover, the inhabitants of the
town are scarcely typical Bretons; they are a little demoralised by
success in trade, a little inclined to smuggling, and decidedly fond of
drinking. The men, living hard lives, facing the most fearful storms of
the Atlantic in their exposed little boats, out sometimes for days without
a take, are apt to be uproarious when on shore. The hardy, bright-featured
women of Cornouaille, whose faces are becoming so familiar
to us in these pages, have a rather sad and reckless look at
Douarnenez; their homes are not too tidy as a rule; the little
children play in streets which steam with refuse from the sardine
factories, where their elder sisters are working in gangs, with bare
feet and skirts tucked up to their knees, sifting, and sorting, and
cooking sardines, and singing snatches of Breton songs the while.
The lower streets, steep and narrow, are blocked with fish-carts, and
the port is crowded with boats with nets drying in festoons. But
the view of Douarnenez seen at a little distance out at sea, with its
high rocks and overhanging trees almost reaching to the water’s edge,
and above, the spire of the old church of Ploaré standing sharp against
the sky, will remain best in the
memory. There is no end to
the beauties of the bay of Douarnenez,
if we explore the neighbourhood,
starting off early for
the day and not returning until
sundown.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the evening there is a great
Bohemian gathering at the Hôtel
du Commerce; its artistic visitors
overflow into the street, and make
themselves heard as well as seen.
There is a clatter of tongues and
a cloud of smoke issuing from
the little café presided over by
the neat figure in the sketch.
Those who have been to the
Hôtel du Commerce at Douarnenez
will recognise the portrait
at once; those who have not
must picture to themselves a girl
with dark hair and brown complexion, a headdress and bodice in
which scarlet and gold are intermingled, a dark skirt with a border
of yellow or orange, and a spotless white apron and sleeves. In soft
shoes she flits silently through the rooms and supplies our clamorous
wants in turn; neither remonstrance nor flattery will move her, or
cause her to raise her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children of Douarnenez have learned to beg, and along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>broad road which leads to Quimper, beggars are stationed at intervals
to waylay the charitable. Driving home in the little covered carriage
shown in the sketch, a dark object appears before us on the way.
Near it, at the side of the road, is a little shed roughly made with
poles and brambles, and, protruding from it, two sabots filled with
straw, two sticks, and a pair of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bragous bras</span></i>. The rest of the structure
consists of dried ferns, and a poor deaf human creature propped up
to receive the alms of the charitable, a grim figure watching and
waiting in the sun and wind.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>Fourteen miles south-east of Quimper
is Concarneau, another important fishing
station of Cornouaille. It is well to go
thither by road, in order to see the view
of Quimper and the valley below, when
a few miles out of the town; a view which
few travellers see in these days. The old
town of <span class='sc'>Concarneau</span>, with its fortifications
and towers, called “Ville Close,” which in its
position somewhat resembles St. Malo, is
approached by a drawbridge from the mainland,
and at high tide is surrounded by
water; it consists of one long irregular street with old houses shut in
by dark walls, through the loopholes of which we see the sea. The
nominal population of Concarneau is 5000, but in the Faubourg Ste.
Croix, where the fleet of fishing-boats come and go at every tide, the
population is upwards of 10,000. There is a fine modern aquarium, and
there are several interesting monuments in the immediate neighbourhood,
but there is nothing very remarkable in the situation of the
town itself, and it is certainly not a place for visitors to stay in;
the work of life at Concarneau is to catch and cure little fishes, and
the odours of the dead and the dying, the cured and the fried, pervade
the air. The hedges are made of the cuttings of sardine boxes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>
<img src='images/illus102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>We happen to see Concarneau at its best on a fine summer’s
morning, when the wide quay of the Faubourg Ste. Croix, where
the sketch is taken, is alive with people, the majority on their way
to church across the drawbridge in the Ville Close. The little fleet
of fishing-boats is moored in a cluster at the quay; the nets are
drying in the sun <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></i>, and the cork floats hang from the masts
in graceful festoons. Everyone is in holiday attire, and seems bent
upon going somewhere—to church, for a drive in the country, or for
an excursion out to sea. The fishermen and workmen have for the
most part disappeared into the wine-shops, whence their hilarity overflows
into the streets. The girls employed in the sardine factories
have put on their best dresses and neatest shoes, and go in companies
of six or eight together to the church. Their smooth white caps and
lappets glisten in the clear air which blows lightly from the south-east,
and the odours of sardines are for the time forgotten. It is the
time and the spot from which to take away an impression of Concarneau,
for its ordinary everyday aspect is not romantic. The
procession of people coming from church down the old-fashioned
street, shut in by walls and towers, makes a good picture. The
majority wear their proper costume, as sketched on opposite page;
a few only have fallen into temptation, and carry bonnets, trains,
and high heels across the <em>Place</em>.</p>

the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme de chambre</span></i> is putting the last touches to her toilet—but
behind it are narrow, dirty streets, crowded cafés and estaminets, where
the husbands of these white-capped women have disappeared for the
day. The majority of the well-to-do inhabitants are <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en promenade</span></i>
under the trees, and nearly everyone is bent upon pleasure of some
sort. Here is a party just starting for a boating excursion across the
bay, singing a Breton air to the time of the rowers, which we can
hear on the quay. The sketch gives the exact picture: the heavy
fishing-boat built for rough weather and stormy seas; the rowers
standing four abreast, the heavy oars plashing in the sunlight, the
boat down at the stern with its holiday load; whilst the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamin</span></i> of

<p class='c000'>The sketch on the quay when the tide is out, with people
waiting for the ferry-boat, gives the aspect looking seaward, on a
quiet evening, as we drive away towards <span class='sc'>Pont-Aven</span>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>To reach Pont-Aven, we ascend and descend some gently sloping
hills, in an easterly direction, for about eight miles. On the left hand
of the road, near the village of Trégunc; we pass one of the largest
rocking stones in Brittany, a block of granite 12 feet long by 9 feet,
poised upon a second slab half buried in
the ground. Little children lie in wait for
travellers, and move this stone, which is
known far and wide as “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La pierre aux
maris trompés</span>,” a stone by which husbands
are said to test the fidelity of
their wives. All the heath-covered land
on the way to Pont-Aven is strewn with
granite boulders; there is a celebrated
dolmen, or “table stone,” in the neighbourhood,
and, near at hand, at Rustéphan,
are the picturesque remains of a fifteenth-century
castle, which may be reached
through a wood by leaving the road at
the village of Nizon, two miles from Pont-Aven.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a point where the river Aven—breaking
through its narrow channel, dashing
under bridges and turning numerous
water-wheels—spreads out into a broad
estuary, is the little port of Pont-Aven, built four miles from the
sea. The majority of the houses are of granite, and sheltered
under wooded hills; the water rushes past flour-mills and under bridges
with perpetual noise, and a breeze stirs the poplar trees that line its
banks on the calmest day. The widest part of the village is the
<em>Place</em>, sketched (looking northwards) from the stone bridge which gives
Pont-Aven its name. A small community of farmers, millers, fishermen
and peasant-women, is its native population, supplemented in
summer by a considerable foreign element.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Pont-Aven is a favourite spot for artists, and a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra incognita</span></i> to
the majority of travellers in Brittany. Here the art student, who
has spent the winter in the Quartier Latin in Paris, comes when the
leaves are green, and settles down for the summer to study undisturbed.
How far he succeeds depends upon himself; his surroundings
are delightful, and everything he needs is to be obtained in an easy
way that will sound romantic and impossible in 1879. Pont-Aven
being set in a valley between two thickly wooded hills, opening out
southwards to the sea, the climate is temperate and favourable to
outdoor work. In the centre of the village is a little triangular
<em>Place</em>, and at the broad end, facing the sun, is the principal inn, the
Hôtel des Voyageurs, which, at the time of writing, has an excellent
hostess, who takes <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i> for about five francs a day, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout
compris</span>,” and where the living is as good and plentiful as can be
desired. This popular hostelry is principally supported by American
artists, some of whom have lived here all through the year; but
many English and French painters have stayed at Pont-Aven, and
have left contributions in the shape of oil paintings on the panels of
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle à manger</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have mentioned the Hôtel des Voyageurs; but there are
other inns; there is the Hôtel du Lion d’Or, also on the <em>Place</em>,
frequented principally by French artists and travellers; and down by
the bridge, a quaint little auberge (with a signboard painted by one
of the inmates), the Pension Gloanec. This is the true Bohemian
home at Pont-Aven, where living is even more moderate than at
the inns. Here the panels of the rooms are also decorated with
works of art, and here, in the evening, and in the morning, seated
round a table in the road, dressed in the easy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i> fashion of
the country, may be seen artists whose names we need not print,
but many of whose works are known over the world. The resources
of these establishments are elastic, accommodation being afforded, if
necessary, for fifty or sixty <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i>, by providing beds a few
yards off in the village. The cost of living, board and lodging, at
the Pension Gloanec, including two good meals a day with cider, is
<em>sixty francs</em> a month! When we add that the bedrooms are clean
and bright, especially those provided in the neighbouring cottages, we
have said enough about creature comforts, which are popularly supposed
to be unknown in Brittany. The materials for work and
opportunities for study are similar to those in Wales, with fewer
distractions than at Bettwys-y-Coed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>At Pont-Aven the presiding genius at the Hôtel des Voyageurs
is one Mademoiselle Julia Guillou. At this little inn, as at the Hôtel
du Commerce at Douarnenez, the traveller need not be surprised to
find that the conversation at table is of the Paris <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salon</span></i>, to find
bedrooms and lofts turned into studios, and a pervading smell of oil
paint. It is said of Pont-Aven that it is “the only spot in Europe
where Americans are content to live all the year round”; but perhaps
the kind face and almost motherly care of her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i> by the
portly young hostess, Mademoiselle Julia Guillou, has something to
do with their content.</p>

<p class='c000'>The views in the neighbourhood of Pont-Aven are beautiful, and
the cool avenues of beeches and chestnut trees, a distinctive feature
of the country, extend for miles. From one of these avenues, on the
high ground leading to an ancient chapel, there is a view over the
village where we can trace the windings of the river far away towards
the sea, and where the white sails of the fishing-boats seem to
pass between the trees. The sides of the valleys are grey with
rocks, and the fields slope steeply down to the slate roofs of the
cottages built by the streams, where women, young and old, beautiful
and the reverse, may be seen washing amongst the stones.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Returning from Labour, Pont-Aven.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Pont-Aven has one advantage over other places in Brittany; its
inhabitants in their picturesque costume (which remains unaltered)
have learned that to sit as a model is a pleasant and lucrative
profession, and they do this for a small fee without hesitation or
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</span>.” This is a point of great importance to the artist,
and one which some may be glad to learn through these pages.
The peasants, both men and women, are glad to sit for a franc for
the greater part of a day; it is only at harvest time, when field
labourers are scarce, that the demand may be greater than the supply.
and recruits have to be found in the neighbouring fishing villages.
Once or twice a week in the summer, a beauty comes over from
Concarneau in a cart, her face radiant in the sunshine, the white
lappets of her cap flying in the wind. Add to these opportunities
for the study of peasant life and costume the variety of scenery,
and the brightness and warmth of colour infused into everything
under a more southern sun than England, and it will be seen that
there are advantages here not to be overlooked by the painter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picturesque town of <span class='sc'>Quimperlé</span> on the rivers Ellé and Isole,
from which so many English travellers have been scared, in years gone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>by, by Murray’s laconic admonition, “No good inn,” is a most pleasant
and comfortable resting-place. It is approached on a high level
when coming by railway from Quimper, the road from the station
winding round the hills down to the <em>Place</em>, where there is the comfortable
Hôtel des Voyageurs. On arriving at Quimperlé, the aspect
of the people is more cosmopolitan, for we are approaching the
borders of the province of Morbihan, and are on the highway between
Nantes and Brest.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus112.jpg' alt='at Quimperlé Station' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The people at the station are not numerous, and they are nearly
all third-class travellers. The quiet, almost taciturn company consists
of a tourist, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergent de ville</span></i>, a commercial man of Quimperlé, the
same old woman that we meet everywhere on our travels, in the comfortable
dark hood and cape of the country, and a peasant-woman
taking home her sack of meal, sketched on the opposite page.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quimperlé contains about 6500 inhabitants, principally occupied
in agriculture. It is surrounded by hills covered with orchards
and gardens shut in by high walls; an old and sleepy place,
full of memories of the past, and with, apparently, little ambition
for the future. There is an ancient abbey church, built in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>eleventh century, on the plan of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem; in
the crypt is the tomb of St. Gurloës, one of the early abbots
of Quimperlé. The large grey-roofed building on the <em>Place</em> adjoining
this church, now used as the Mairie, was formerly a convent of
Benedictine nuns; and other buildings, such as the old inn, the
Lion d’Or, were originally used by the abbots of St. Croix.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus113.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>But Quimperlé, in spite of its railway, is a town where grass grows
between the paving-stones of its streets; a place which owes much
of its attraction to its picturesque site and its ancient buildings, to its
market-days, its weddings and fêtes. In the lower town there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>some old narrow streets, with most picturesque wooden gables, and
there is one dilapidated square, called “the Place of Revolution,”
where there would seem little left to destroy.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus114.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>A painter might well make Quimperlé a centre of operations, for
its precincts are little known; the gardens shine with laden fruit-trees,
and the hills are rich in colour until late in autumn; and in
the evening there is no better place for rest than under the trees
on the Place Nationale. Here the people pass to and fro, as in
the sketch on the opposite page; there are more women than
men to be seen, for the latter are resting from their labours, in the
cafés. Beyond, and high above this group, are the houses of the old
town, surmounted by the two square Gothic towers, with spires covered
with lichen, of the church of St. Michel. Under the trees near the
river are women selling sardines and fruit. The position of the bridge
over the Ellé is indicated by the man leaning over the stone parapet.
The man with the cart has just come in with wood for winter fires.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>On the Place at Quimperlé.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The great attraction to Quimperlé is in the country round; in
the beauty of the woods and the windings of the streams. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>neighbourhood the artist and the angler may settle down together
and spend the summer months delightfully.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>A Big Load.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We said that Quimperlé, a town with a railway station, on the
great highway between Nantes and Brest, owes most of its life and
picturesque attraction to women, weddings, fêtes, and flowers. Let us
picture a prominent personage at the old Hôtel du Lion d’Or. She
had a beautiful name, <em>Augustine</em>, pronounced with enviable accuracy
by all the household. She hovered about us like a fairy, attending
to our wants in the most delicate way; to outward seeming a
ministering angel with pure white wings, but, in truth, a drudge, a
methodical housewife, massive, and hard to the touch. She did the
work of three Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">garçons</span></i>, and walked upstairs unaided with portmanteaus
which it would require two men to lift, anywhere out of
Brittany. She slept in a box in the kitchen, and dressed “somehow”
in five minutes. She ate what was left, contentedly, at the end of
the day, and rose at sunrise to do the laborious work of the house;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>helping also at harvest-time in the fields. She had the sweetest of
smiles (when she liked), an unconquerable habit of taking snuff, and
a murderous way of killing fowls in the early morning which we
shall not easily forget.</p>

<p class='c000'>How it comes to pass that this girl of nineteen occupies such an
important position in the household is one of those things which are
peculiar to Brittany. The strong individuality,
industry, and force of character
of the women make themselves
felt wherever we go. Whilst the men
slumber and smoke, the women are
building little fortunes or propping up
old ones. All through the land, in the
houses, in the factories, and in the fields,
the strong, firm hand and arm of a
woman <em>does the work</em>.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus117.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Augustine.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The pedestrian or sportsman, in his
wanderings through Brittany, will, if he
knows the country, seek, at the end
of a long day, the country <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">auberge</span></i>
where a “household fairy” presides.
The land is full of legends and tales
of gnomes and witches, but the reality
is a white-capped figure, that welcomes
the traveller at the inn door the modern
representative of “mine host.” Her brightness and attraction, and at
the same time her whole armour and coat of mail, are her stiffly
starched cap, epaulets, and apron of spotless white. She presides
at the fêtes and weddings which are celebrated at the inns, and joins
in the frolics at the end of the day, dancing with the rest up and
down the street, and submitting with modest but hearty goodwill to
some rather demonstrative tokens of esteem. “How is it that these
widespread collars are never crumpled?” some one asks. “Oh, we
just turn them round and throw them over the shoulder for a minute!”
is the quick answer.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Let us refer to our notebook to see how one of these weddings is
managed in Quimperlé in 1878. It is just after harvest, and the time
for rest and festivity in many a village round. Coats and gowns that
have been laid by for months are brought out, and many an antique-shaped
garment sees the light for the first time for a year. Two or
three weddings are arranged for the same day, and at early morning
all meet at Quimperlé. The girls come on foot, dressed in their local
costumes, excepting a little innovation of finery here and there; the
“boys,” for they are little more in age, have modernised themselves,
and wear a clumsy imitation of the conventional suit of black, being
especially proud of Parisian hats. But excepting in the matter of
costume, they do as their forefathers did; they spend the day in the
streets of Quimperlé, parading arm-in-arm with their brides, stopping
to take, and to give, refreshment at every inn-door and at the homes
of all their friends. We meet them early in the morning crossing the
principal square; they have registered their marriages, and have taken
the sacrament in the church of St. Michel, in the upper town, and
for the rest of the long summer day and half into the night they dance
the “De Rober” up and down the streets, hand in hand together, to the
music of the bag-pipe and the flageolet.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>From Quimperlé to Hennebont by road or
railway, we pass Pont Scorff, where is the
boundary line which divides the departments of
Finistère and Morbihan. We enter now the district
of Bas-Bretagne, the Arcadia of Brittany, of
which so much has been written and sung by
French writers, and of which only those who
have lingered in its byways have discovered the
charm. It is the part of Brittany most interesting from its historic
associations, the land most strewn with dolmens and menhirs, and
mysterious Druidical remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>Holiday travellers from Quimper to Vannes pass by the large
and busy town of L’Orient because it is described, truly, as “an
uninteresting modern town with straight streets and quays,” and many
also pass by <span class='sc'>Hennebont</span>. There is no historic interest in L’Orient,
whose 40,000 inhabitants are busy in shipping and trade—the trade,
amongst other things, of importing foreign spirits and tobacco, and
of planting in every village in Brittany the cheap manufactured cottons
and fineries which stamp out individuality in costume, the last stronghold
of self-respect amongst the peasants, both men and women. In
every remote village, on church walls and on mediæval towers, is posted
in glowing colours the announcement of a Grand Magasin des Modes
at L’Orient, and every afternoon there comes by train to Hennebont
the <cite>Petit Journal</cite> to complete the work of civilisation; a little journal,
distributed by hand to all who possess a sou, giving in its daily sheet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>little beyond Parisian gossip, but containing sometimes some strange
paragraphs like the following, which would seem of doubtful interest
to Bretons:—</p>

<p class='c018'>“—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On adoucit les mains et on les habitue à des mouvements aristocratiques.</span>”</p>

<p class='c018'>“—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On communique aux jeunes ladies le nom et la profession de leur futur mari.</span>”</p>

<p class='c018'>“—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On enseigne l’élégance et la grâce en douze heures, succès garanti.</span>”</p>

<p class='c018'>“—<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">On loue et on échange de petits enfants.</span>”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus121.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Hennebont is only five miles from L’Orient, and of course some
of the inhabitants wear the modern dress, but it is still very primitive-looking,
being seldom visited by strangers. Sloping southward towards
the river, where ships are loading and unloading at the little port, is the
chief street, shown in the sketch opposite. Hennebont is an old historic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>town, containing about 5000 inhabitants, and is the natural outlet
for the produce of the surrounding country. At the upper end the
street widens into a grass-grown <em>Place</em>, where is the church of Notre
Dame de Paradis, with its square tower and lofty recessed portal, the
work, it is believed, of an English architect in the sixteenth century, a
structure not in any way very remarkable. The town is divided
into the comparatively modern Ville Neuve, sketched above, the
Ville Close, and the Vieille Ville on the right bank of the Blavet,
memorable for its sieges in the War of Succession in Brittany, and
for the exploits of the Countess of Montfort in defending the city
in the fourteenth century, of which Froissart gives a spirited account in
his Chronicles.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the high-street of the town, the Ville Neuve, are the two
principal inns, we can hardly call them hotels, outside one of which
a traveller reposes after the midday meal; and a little below are the
older hostelries, where there have been numerous arrivals during the
day. Opposite, on a low wall, is a shelter of trees, a favourite
lounge, whither come in the afternoon the old and the young to talk,
to quarrel, and to flirt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Sit down on the wall and watch the passers by. First a cart,
drawn by diminutive bullocks, heavily laden with field produce, comes
lumbering down, the driver in broad-brimmed hat and heavy sabots;
next, a clatter of hoofs and a troop of high-bred horses, led or ridden
by riders in scarlet coats and white trousers, pass down to the river;
they come from the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haras</span></i> in the neighbourhood, one of the government
breeding establishments; this gives a dash of colour and a style to
Hennebont quite foreign to its ordinary aspect. Next, with heavy,
measured tread, comes a procession, half solemn, half grotesque, of
reapers and professional <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">batteurs</span></i> changing their quarters. Next
comes out and stands at the door of the Hôtel de France the innkeeper,
dressed, unlike most of his neighbours, in a frock-coat and
hat; a slim man in dandy Parisian attire, almost the only black figure
to be seen in Hennebont.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Women pass busily up and down, carrying heavy loads, some with
the white lappets of their caps thrown backward, treading heavily like
beasts of burden. Excepting for a short time in the heat of the day,
when the men rest and the women knit, there are few unemployed
hands in Hennebont.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evening brings more activity, the farmers and their wives pack
up and depart in their country carts, shutters open in the dark grey-stone
houses on the <em>Place</em> near the church; the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maire</span></i> and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">avocat</span></i>
take a walk, or a drive with their families; and women and children
emerge on various errands. It is then that out of side streets, and
doorways in walls unlocked with heavy keys, issue, one by one, the
fairest inhabitants of Morbihan, some especially erect, bearing earthen
vessels on their heads, wending their way up the town to a road beyond
the church, where, under the cool shade of trees, and partly shut in by
walls, is the fountain which supplies Hennebont with water. It is a
rendezvous for old and young, men, women, and cattle, a place to see
and to sketch, charming in its sheltered aspect after a midday sun;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>women coming and going with their pitchers; men helping or bringing
cattle to water, and numerous washing parties on their knees.</p>

if we follow the narrow, winding streets of the Ville Close, sheltered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>by trees and overshadowed by walls, we come suddenly upon an old
time-stained doorway like that below; and, amongst the people that
crowd the poorer quarter, are many quaint and interesting groups.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>They are a pleasant, homely people at Hennebont; a town worth
visiting before simplicity, individuality, and local costume have passed
away.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>It is a pleasant change, even from the
quiet of Hennebont, to wind slowly up
the hills covered thickly with ferns and
woods, to disturb the magpies on the roads,
and the yellowhammer and the lizards on
the rough stone walls; to see the silent
peasants knee-deep in the fields, the little
black and white cattle tethered to pasture,
the black and brown sheep grazing in the
open land, and the pigs at the cottage doors.
It is a considerable ascent from the town through an undulating landscape
of woods and streams and ferns; the valleys green in their depths,
the trees turning gold and brown where they fringe the hills.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Reaping near Hennebont.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>As we approach Le Faouet, the scene changes gradually to a
sterner aspect, the trees are less luxuriant, and the soil is less fruitful.
Here and there we pass on the road a busy harvest scene, the people
turning round at the sound of approaching wheels to watch the
travellers pass. It is the farmer himself that gazes at us, half
amused; the time for harvest is short on these rainy hills, and so
master and man, and every available help, work early and late to
get in the crops. The sun that shines so brilliantly to-day, and lights
up the harvest field with a golden glow, will disappear in a few
hours, and the fields may be a wreck from the wind and rain. Every
now and then a deep shadow is thrown over the land from the
clouds that drift eastward from the sea, but they are high in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>heavens to-day, and the sky is of an almost Eastern blue. Before us
northwards the horizon is of a colder hue, and as we ascend the last
long hill to Le Faouet, the cupola on the church tower and the grey
roofs of the houses with their backgrounds of firs have by contrast
a sombre tinge.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus133.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>On the road from Quimperlé to Le Faouet a stream is crossed
that divides the two provinces of Finistère and Morbihan; it is a
stream well stocked with trout; in fact, in most of these rivers there
is excellent fishing, and there are no better headquarters for sport
than Le Faouet. The town, which is well situated and has fine views
of the country, contains not more than 3000 inhabitants, nearly all
but the oldest and the poorest being engaged in agriculture. It is a
great centre on certain days, when the people collect under the
eaves of the market-place shown in the full-page sketch.</p>

<p class='c000'>But excepting the visits of a few sportsmen and tourists in
summer, Le Faouet is scarcely ever visited by the outer world.
The houses are built of stone, old and covered with lichen; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>covered market-place has heavy wooden eaves, and is protected
by ancient elms; the inhabitants are dressed for the most part in
rough and primitive fashion, the men in white cloth jackets, loose
breeches, and sabots, and
the women in dark comfortable
cloth hoods, as in
the sketch at the head of
this chapter.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus134.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is a quiet, self-contained,
dignified population
at Le Faouet, approached
at intervals by the commercial
traveller, and a few
cattle- and horse-dealers,
but holding otherwise little
communication with towns.
Here, in this neighbourhood,
we may contemplate
the typical Breton, who,
braced physically to withstand
the shocks of the
tempest, resists with an
almost irresistible <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vis inertia</span></i>
the advance of French
civilisation; whom neither
the progress of steam nor
compulsory education has
much disturbed. He has,
for trading purposes, acquired some knowledge of French, but he keeps
this knowledge to himself, and never displays it unnecessarily; he has
thus an advantage over strangers, who may imagine he cannot understand
a word.</p>

<p>LE FAOUET.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>To come into a quiet village like Le Faouet with no purpose but
observation requires a certain amount of courage, and, if it were not
that a little more than a mile north of Le Faouet there is the famous
chapel of Ste. Barbe, and southward about two miles, in an old
church, there is an elaborately carved rood-screen, we might hesitate to
take up our quarters here. Unless a man has business in Le Faouet
unless he is an antiquary, a fisherman, or a painter, he would leave
it the day he entered. It is not, however, uncommon for the landlord
of the Hôtel du Lion d’Or to have <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pensionnaires</span></i> who stay for
the summer.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus136.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In spite of the grandeur of its situation, the solidity of its
buildings, and the evident industry of the inhabitants, there is a
dreary, ruinous look about the <em>Place</em> of Le Faouet even on a
summer’s day. What must it be in winter winds? On the brightest
and driest day of the year many of the houses are dark and
unhealthy-looking, built close together, with narrow lanes of mud
and filth between them. What must they be when the rains begin?</p>

<p class='c000'>We have seen in Le Faouet some of the finest types of Bretons,
both men and women. Let us record one figure which will never be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>effaced from memory. Passing down a street leading from the
principal square, we meet coming up the hill bareheaded, in the full
blaze of the sun, in the dust and heat, the strange, wild-looking
figure in the sketch; his clothes are patched, his hair is white, his
face red; with crutches, and one leg, he drags (with the help of a
dog and one or two charitable children) his house, with him about
the town. It is a strange conveyance made of sticks and dried
ferns, but it is <em>home</em>. Travellers see strange sights, but surely no
sight more grotesque was ever seen than “the man on two sticks”
of Le Faouet, whose portrait is given to the life.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus137.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Le Faouet, a visit should be made to the fifteenth-century
church of St. Fiacre, to see the fine rood-screen elaborately
carved with figures representing scenes in the life of Christ, panels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>of elaborate and grotesque workmanship. The work on this screen
was partly executed in 1480 and in 1627, and the whole was restored,
painted, and gilt in 1866. There is also some fine stained glass,
dating from 1552.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the chapel of <span class='sc'>Ste. Barbe</span> is a shaded walk of about a mile
and a half—first through narrow lanes and broad avenues, then up a
steep ascent where the path is sometimes cut in steps in the rock. It
brings us in half an hour to a high plateau fringed with furze and
wind-blown pines. The view from the eminence is magnificent: the
eye wanders eastward and southward, over a broad valley with a
mountain stream, the Ellé winding first through beds of rocks,
then into pastures, and disappearing in cultivated fields. As we
walk to the edge of this mountain-side, where there is only a small
hut visible, the panorama increases in extent over the country, and
the variety of colour, from the grey of scattered boulders and blue
of pines, to the deep green of the meadows and woods, forms a
scene of such natural beauty that we almost forget the object of
our mission.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chapel of Ste. Barbe, approached down a flight of steps, is
actually close to our feet; it is built of granite under the hillside,
sheltered from the winds by enormous rocks and trees, and with a
steep declivity below; a solid granite structure fitted into the hillside,
so to speak, the space not permitting the nave of the chapel to be
in the usual position. In the interior—which is shown by an old man
in tatters who kneels at the altar whilst we walk round—is a gallery
with carved panels, supported by seraphim holding shields, and grotesque
animals on the mouldings; there is also some old stained glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a tradition attaching to this chapel, that a knight, hunting
in the neighbourhood in the fifteenth century, was overtaken by a
storm in the valley below, and, being preserved from falling rocks
by the prayers of Ste. Barbe, erected this chapel to her memory.
From that day there has been an annual pilgrimage to Ste. Barbe,
when some of the devotees creep round the precipitous exterior walls
as an act of penance. Before leaving, we pass up the rough stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>steps in the sketch to even higher ground, where there is a small
chapel dedicated to St. Michel. It is fortunate to have seen the
view from Ste. Barbe on a clear day, for the clouds, which gather
in the distance, as white as snow, through the tree tops, come up in
a few hours and shroud the land.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus138.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Ten miles in a north-westerly direction, in some of the finest
scenery of the Montagnes Noires, is <span class='sc'>Gourin</span>, a small town in the
centre of a district of old iron mines, stone and slate quarries. Mr.
Caldecott, who visited this district in a previous year, in bad weather,
speaks of the “wide, dirty, uninteresting-looking street of Gourin, at
the top of which is the Hôtel du Cheval Blanc,” but he has
made a sketch of the women washing at a stream just outside the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>town, which only wants colour to be one of the most picturesque of
our series.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Excepting for fishing, shooting, or perchance to record the forms
and colours of the mountains in a sketch, few visitors will find their
way to Gourin, even in summer; but the following notes by the artist
may be interesting to travellers:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“The dining-room of the inn at Gourin opens on to the public <em>Place</em>,
and is frequented by commercial travellers and two or three residents;
one of the latter, being a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasseur</span></i>, is followed through the glass door
by a pack of hounds, the large sporting spaniels of the country, and at
each guest’s elbow a dog stations himself to receive gratuities.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“After resting for the night in a comfortable room, separate from
the main premises, I hire a vehicle to take me to Le Faouet, as the
morning is wet; a long-bodied cart, drawn by a white horse, with the
wheels set forward and a shifting seat, on which is a large pillow.
We drive through a hilly, wooded country in a high wind.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus140.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>“<span class='sc'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montez, s’il vous plait, Monsieur!</span></span>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The storm is so severe at Le Faouet that “slates are blown
from the roofs of the houses, men grasp their hats, women tack
hither and thither across the square, and geese take advantage of
the breeze and try to fly.” On the way to Ste. Barbe, “a tall
tree crashes across the path, which is strewn with unripe acorns,
chestnuts, apples, fir cones, leaves, and twigs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The hurricane that was experienced here swept over the whole of
Brittany with great violence, and, according to the <cite>Journal de Rennes</cite>,
“laid low at least a thousand trees.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Up and down again on a good road, a drive of seventeen miles
from Le Faouet takes us to <span class='sc'>Guéméné</span>, meeting a few reapers, and
a cart drawn by bullocks in charge of men who have succumbed
to thirst and heat.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus141.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>We halt halfway at the poor village of Kernascléden, where there
is hardly an inhabitant to be seen, but where, abutting on the high-road,
is a beautiful Gothic church, rich in carving and grand in proportion,
a striking contrast to the hovels which immediately surround
it. It is a good example of fifteenth-century work, built at the same
time as the church of St. Fiacre, and by the same founder. There
is a legend here too curious not to repeat, that angels aided in
the building of these two beautiful churches, carrying the tools, which
were scarce in those days, backwards and forwards from one church
to the other, to aid the workmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Guéméné, a little town on the river Scorff, we are still in the
interior of the country. It is in some ways more civilised than
Le Faouet, but as far removed from railways, and with as little
communication with the outer world.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>
<img src='images/illus142.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us first give our experiences of the principal inn, which is on
the left, looking up the street in the sketch, where travellers are
driven under an archway into a wide stable-yard, and enter the house
by the kitchen. The beds are clean and comfortable enough, the fare
is homely but plentiful, and there is nothing to scare away the most
fastidious. At the midday meal we have trout, caught a little way
down the river Scorff, one or two dishes of meat, an omelette if
desired, and, as usual, very good bread, butter, and cider. The
dinner, or evening meal, is rather more elaborate, especially if a
fresh traveller has come in. The view, across the table at breakfast
time, of the presiding genius of the inn, the bottle of cider, the large
wineglass, and the half cut loaf, are all depicted exactly. The
vacant chair is soon to be occupied by a commercial traveller, who
has been busy all the morning in the town, doing more havoc in the
one day that he devotes to Guéméné than we like to think of. He
represents a cheap clothier’s house at L’Orient, and has tempted many
of the quiet inhabitants to change their simple stuffs and white caps
for the more fashionable dresses and hats of the town. It should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>remembered, however, that it is to this very <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">commis voyageur</span></i>, whom
we travellers are apt to treat with scant courtesy and whose proceedings
we often regard with anything but pleasure, that we owe
the comforts of these inns, and the possibility of travel in remote
places. The commercial traveller, coming from Vannes or L’Orient
is the pioneer in such towns as Guéméné; he teaches the Breton
innkeeper the mysteries of civilised life, and the art of living
differently from the lower animals. It is a heavy penalty to pay,
from the artistic point of view, that he should bring his patterns and
his sham jewellery, and leave so much of it behind in Guéméné.
But our little waiting-maid is not yet converted to the policy of
adopting modern ways. Her spotless white cap and sleeves, neat
dress, and rows of pendent coins, are of a pattern as old and characteristic
as the gables of the houses of Guéméné.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus143.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>So bright and charming is our little maid this morning that it is
difficult to believe that she came out of a carved wooden bedstead
let into the wall of the kitchen (a bed of two stories, holding four!),
that she does most of the work of the hotel, and helps in the stable.
It is enough for us to record that travellers are well cared for; that
Englishmen come here for the fishing, and sometimes stay for weeks,
living at the rate of four or five francs a day, including everything.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus144.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The streets of Guéméné are full of people on Sunday morning—men
in short jackets, wide trousers, and black, broad-brimmed hats, old
women in the comfortable <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffe</span></i> sketched above, girls with white caps and
stomachers, short dresses, and neat shoes, all coming into the church and
afterwards meeting in the street. These are principally country people;
but the inhabitant of Guéméné, the small <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">propriétaire</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</span></i>, who
lives in the town, often wears a semi-nautical attire, as sketched overleaf.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
<img src='images/illus145.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Five old women sit together in the road, their chairs drawn
together for company, and to make an inclosure for two or three
little tottering inhabitants of Guéméné, who at the age of three are
dressed in the costume of their ancestors. Here the harmony of
costume and architecture, both in form and colour, strikes the eye at
once, and we want nothing to complete the picture. There is
nothing, it seems, to add, nothing to leave out; let us stay for a month
(we are inclined to say) and sketch in the high-street of Guéméné
such figures as are standing talking together at an old-fashioned
doorway, opposite to our inn. But the scene soon changes, and out
of one of the old houses, dark in the interior, with a floor below the
level of the street, comes a lady with a nurse and child; she has a
light dress with a train, a hat with scarlet feathers, and a parasol.
She is going for a promenade, and, as she passes down the street, is
greeted by the old women thus: “See they carry their tails in their
hands, these fine demoiselles!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>The Café du Nord is a favourite house of call, and thither the
men resort to play at cards or billiards, whilst the women bring out
their chairs and sit under the eaves, knitting, gossiping, and watching
the passers-by.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is no traffic in the streets, and no fear of being disturbed.
A newspaper may arrive in the evening to inform the inhabitants of
the last market prices, or that a workman has fallen out of a window
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>in Paris. A very few items of local intelligence suffice for Guéméné,
which is too much occupied with its own interests to care for what
the rest of the world calls news. The sun and moon rise and set
for Guéméné alone; it is the “boss” of <em>their</em> wheel of life.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus147.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>We have seen only the high-street of Guéméné, but the town
should be viewed from above, with its grey roofs, its church tower,
and the ruins of a castle eight hundred years old, in the midst
of beautiful hills, bright with gorse, and grey with granite boulders;
and a view reaching far away over a wooded valley with the river
Scorff winding towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one evening there is a great gathering at the old café with
high-pitched roof, at the division of the two streets at the top of the
sketch on page <a href='#Page_165'>165</a>. The daughter of the popular hostess has been
betrothed at the presbytery, and in a month she is to be married.
She has her <em>dot</em>, or portion, of a few hundred francs, and her
husband that is to be, his little farm; they have met to celebrate
the occasion, and their immediate friends make merry until far into
the night. They all sit together round a rough table in the little
room, the lamps lighting the girls’ faces, the men in blouses or
white jackets, with bright buttons; a background of timbered ceiling,
smoke, laughter, songs, and jollity, continued long after the lights
go out in the street and the moon rises over the valley. All will go
well with them if the bottle which first drew them together does not
scatter their happiness too soon.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>On the 24th of July we take up our
quarters at the comfortable Hôtel
Pavillon d’en Haut, at Auray. To-morrow
is the great day of the Pardon of Ste. Anne,
the occasion of the annual pilgrimage to
the miraculous well, whither from far and
near, on foot and on horseback, in carts
and other strange road conveyances, and
by excursion trains, come pilgrims to the
shrine of Ste. Anne. Like the great
annual gatherings at Guingamp and at
Ste. Anne la Palue, of which we have
spoken, the Pardon of Ste. Anne attracts
a strange medley of people, and thus it
is that the ordinarily quiet little town of Auray, situated four miles
from the shrine, is crowded to overflowing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town of Auray, which contains about 5000 inhabitants, is finely
situated above the river which bears its name. It was formerly a
port of commercial importance, but its trade has drifted to Vannes
and L’Orient, and it is best known to travellers as a starting-point
for visiting the fields of Carnac and Locmariaker; also as a pleasant
and healthy place of residence, where fishing and shooting can be
obtained. There are no objects of great antiquity to be seen at
Auray itself, its historic castle has disappeared, but there is much
to interest the traveller in the old streets with timbered houses,
leading down to the river.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>On a wide <em>Place</em> a few yards off, called the Belvédère, is a column
to ascend to see the view, looking northward and eastward, in the
direction of Vannes, over a wide stretch of cultivated land, pastures,
and woods, dotted with white houses and church spires, one of which
is Ste. Anne d’Auray. Immediately beneath is a rocky, precipitous
path down to the river, with small vessels loading and unloading, and
the grey roofs of toy-like houses and warehouses on the quay. A
sudden cloud of smoke, which curls through the gorse and bushes
which conceal the greater part of the river from view, comes from
a little steamer which has arrived from Belle-Île with the evening
tide, and has brought another crowd of pilgrims for Ste. Anne. All
is quiet and beautiful from this vantage-ground; the air is soft, and
slowly waves the tree-tops in the avenue which skirts the Belvédère
on its southern side; there is nothing to indicate the tumult of to-morrow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus151.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The morning of the 25th of July is bright, and the gilt statue of
Ste. Anne glitters above the trees. If at this moment we could look
down from the spire of its church, upon the country round, we should
see on every road, and across the open land, little dark specks which
are pilgrims all tending one way—to the shrine. They have been
coming all through the night, camping in the fields and sleeping at
the roadside. The broad Roman road from Vannes is covered with
carts and carriages, and more people are arriving by the river.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Evening on the Belvédère, Auray.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The crowd that has assembled in the open square near the church
of Ste. Anne at six in the morning numbers several thousands,
and increases every hour. They are pilgrims of every grade,
from the marquis and his family, who have driven from Vannes
the evening before, and stay comfortably at the large hotel, to the
solitary herdsman in goatskin coat and wooden shoes stuffed with
straw, who has walked for two days and nights from his home in
the Montagnes Noires. But they have come on the same errand, and
will stand side by side before an altar in one of the side chapels, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>burn their candles together. They both believe, or are taught to
believe, in a legend that some time in the seventeenth century a saint
appeared to one Nicolazic, who rented a farm near this spot, and
commanded him to dig in a field for her image, and to erect a chapel
to her memory. They both have heard of the miraculous cures at
the well of Ste. Anne, and believe that no household can prosper, no
ships are safe at sea, no cattle or crops can thrive, unless once a year,
at least, they come to burn
candles to Ste. Anne; and
they both have wife, mother,
or sister christened <em>Anne</em>,
the name in fact of nearly
every child we see to-day.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The miraculous well of
Ste. Anne is in a large inclosure
at the western end
of which is the Scala Santa,
a small, raised chapel, open
to the air and covered by
a cupola; a modern wooden
erection about twenty feet
from the ground, approached
on either side by a covered
flight of steps. It is from
this platform that the opening
ceremony of the Pardon
takes place in the afternoon
of the 25th of July, when after a procession round the town with a brass
band and banners, the bishop of Vannes, or other dignitary, addresses
the people in the open square. The procession is a long one, gay
with the green-and-gold-embroidered vestments of the priests, and
bright with the white robes of the acolytes with their crimson sashes;
a quickly moving procession of bareheaded men singing the litany of
Ste. Anne, with banners (representing different departments and communes)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>waving above them, and silver crosses and relics carried high
in the air. The crowd presses forward to see, and forms a narrow
lane to let them pass to the Scala Santa, where the head of the
procession comes to a standstill, and as many of the priests and
attendants as can crowd on to the steps stand as a sort of bodyguard,
whilst the bishop addresses the multitude assembled in the square
beneath.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus154.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Then the outsiders of the crowd get up and watch the proceedings
(including a cook in white cap and apron, who sits upon
the hotel wall), some eagerly from curiosity apparently, some with
devotion, and some, it must be confessed, with an easy, jaunty air
more appropriate to a show in a country fair. There are several
hundreds on the grass before us in the bright sun, in the glare of
which the sketch was taken, sitting together in parties, kneeling in
prayer, or standing close together intent upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>What those upturned faces were, and what the good bishop saw
beneath him in the crowd, as he rolled forth a discourse full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>earnestness and eloquence, the pencil has recorded in the sketch.
It gives, as no words could describe, the mingled expression of
feeling on the faces of the pilgrims, and tells more eloquently than
any argument that the influence of the Church is on the wane in
Brittany. The words spoken are the old story: first the history of
“the miracle of Ste. Anne,” then an exhortation as to the importance
of confession and of works of charity and masses for the dead. The
costume of the people that listen is nearly the same as in 1623,
when Ste. Anne appeared in a wheat-field to a peasant; and yet—and
in spite of all accounts of the earnest devotion of the people—if
we look at the aspect of the crowd, we seem to understand the
matter better than we ever did before.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stand bareheaded in the sunshine, old and young, rich and
poor; on the left, the pretty <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois’</span></i> daughter, from Auray, in plain
cloth dress, with velvet body, dark green shawl, and neatest of
shoes; behind her, in the background, a contingent from more remote
districts, farmers and small traders, the majority being comfortable
people who have come by train. The spare old woman with eccentric
expression and worn hands, holding purchases, or plunder, in her
apron, is not a pauper, but a hanger-on at a large household, who
has saved money. Next, nearer to us, is a peasant farmer, with
long grey hair, in white jacket and breeches and leathern girdle,
who has come on foot from his home in the interior. He has
walked all through the night to be present at the Pardon, as he has
done every year, going through the round of services and exercises,
contributing several francs in money to the church, buying a few
charms and trinkets, and then plodding home. Behind him, with
stick and umbrella under arm, holding beads in her hand, with fat
red face, a white hood and apron, is a comfortable farmer’s wife from
Baud; on her right an old woman in dark green <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffe</span></i>, framing a screwed-up
face, a study of colour in bronze and green. Behind them is a
tall, bareheaded man with his daughter, two of the best types of
Bretons in the crowd. On the right in the sketch is a pretty figure
with a cross on her breast, with shining face, in the white cap and
wide collar so common in Finistère; and, next, three peasants, old
and wrinkled, bronzed with sun and grime, the common type at
Pardons. Thus—leaving out some of the more hideous aspects of
deformity and disease—this sketch gives an exact picture of the crowd,
and a true idea of the strange mixture of curiosity, amusement, and
religious awe with which the celebration of Ste. Anne is received in
the present day.</p>

<img src='images/illus156.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Let us add a few notes
of the scene on Sunday, the
second day of the Pardon,
when the crowd is greatest,
and when there must be collected
at least 10,000 people;
when, besides the peasants
and country people, visitors
from Paris and other parts
of France have filled to overflowing
the large modern
hotel, the courtyard of which
is full of carriages and conveyances
of all kinds. In the
streets and round the open
square there are booths for
the sale of trinkets and toys,
rosaries, tapers, statuettes, and
medals of Ste. Anne, besides
the more common objects for
sale at a country fair. In the roadway women cook fish and cakes
(<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galettes</span></i>) at charcoal fires; there are itinerant vendors of gigantic
wax candles, there are peep-shows and other amusements, skittles
and games like quoits, played with leaden counters of the size of a five-franc
piece. There is every kind of amusement in honour of Ste. Anne,
and the family meetings and gatherings, that take place round the cafés
and in the open fields, suggest a picnic more than a pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>But it is in the street leading to the church door, and in the
adjoining cloisters of a convent, that the more serious aspects of the
Pardon are to be witnessed, some of which it would be impossible to
record in a sketch.</p>

<p class='c000'>From four o’clock in the morning masses have been said, and
in and out of the church there has been a continual stream of
people, all in holiday attire, and nearly all wearing strings of beads,
crosses, or silver ornaments bearing the image of Ste. Anne. They
form in groups on the grass in the centre of the cloistered square,
close together, some kneeling, some standing erect, with eyes strained
upwards at a cracked and weather-worn statue of the Christ; they tell
their beads, and drop sous into a box at the foot of the cross, the
poorest contributing something.</p>

<p class='c000'>They pass round the cloisters in a continual stream, missing
nothing set down for them, but stopping and kneeling at each
“station” with expressions of devotion and awe at some grotesque
paintings on the walls representing the Passion. They stop and
pray, some on one knee only with beads in hand, some kneeling
low on the pavement, sitting on the heels of their sabots for rest.
They have come a long and weary march, they are at the end of
their pilgrimage, and so it happens that sitting and praying they
fall asleep. A heavy thwack from a neighbour’s umbrella falls upon
the shoulders of the sleepers, and again they go the round.</p>

<p class='c000'>By midday the crowd has increased so that movement in the
road is difficult. Coming slowly up the narrow street—blocked by
carriages, by vendors of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets de dévotion</span>,” and by the crowd
that passes up and down—is an, apparently very poor, old man with
long dark hair, a white sheepskin jacket and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bragous bras</span></i>, a leather
girdle and sabots, holding in his hand a hollow candle three feet
high; it has cost him six sous, and he will place it presently at
the altar in the church with the rest. Following him is a farmer
and his wife, well-to-do people, who have come by train, and combine
a little marketing with their religious observances. Following
them are two young married people with their child, all dressed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the latest costumes of Paris, the father manfully taking off his light-kid
gloves, and carrying his candle to the church with the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene in the church, where services have been held at intervals
all day, and the people crowd to burn candles at the side altars, is
of people handing up babies, beads, and trinkets to be blessed; of the
flaring of candles, of the movements of tired priests, and the perpetual
murmur of prayers.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have spoken often of the simple, practical, and graceful dress
of the women; but here at Auray we must confess that many of the
country people in full holiday attire are anything but graceful in
appearance. At a side altar of the chapel there is a young face,
very fair, with large devotional eyes, deepened in colour and intensity
by her white cap; but below it is a stiff, shapeless bodice as hard
as wood, and a bundle of lower garments piled one upon the other,
till the figure is a rather ungainly sight; her large capable hands
hold her book, her rosary, and a stout umbrella; she is encumbered
with clothing, but she differs from her modernised sisters in one
thing: her dress is not on her mind when she says her prayers. She
is on her knees nearly all day at Auray; but, working or praying,
half her young life has been spent in this position. In spite of the
grotesque element, which is everywhere at Pardons, the sight is often
a sad one; sad, especially, to see so many young faces clouded by
superstitious awe. The saying would seem to apply to Brittany, that
“national piety springs from a fountain of tears.”</p>

<p class='c000'>We have purposely said little of the repulsive side of the spectacle;
of the terrible-looking men and women who have come out of their
hiding-places to kneel at the shrine and to beg from strangers; who
wander about like savages, and are propitiated with beads. Figures
strange, weird, and grotesque, the like of which we shall see nowhere
else in the world, pass round the cloisters of St. Anne d’Auray for two
days in the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one half witted man from the sea-coast, evidently soon
“going home”; as he drags himself along, the shadows seem to deepen,
and the light from human eyes to burn more fiercely in their tenement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Fed with seaweed, thatched with straw, exposed to the wildest winds
of the Atlantic, his home little better than a hole in the rocks, what
wonder that he comes across the hills once a year to the Pardon of
Ste. Anne for a blessing; that he prays for
a land beyond the sea, visioned in his mind
by innumerable candles, and paid for in
advance through weary years in his Passage
to the Cross!</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus157.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Many of the pilgrims go through other
religious observances before leaving Auray,
including washing in the well, going step by
step up the Scala Santa on their hands and knees; and all—the poorest
and most pitiable—leave <em>something</em> in the coffers of Ste. Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the long day passes, and at last the tide recedes. What if
a strong north wind and the running river Auray could bear them
away seaward to be seen no more? What if all the wretchedness,
dirt, and disease, collected, as if by a miracle, at Ste. Anne for two
days, could, by another miracle as great, be swept away for ever!</p>

<h3 class='c015'><span class='sc'>Carnac.</span></h3>

<p class='c016'>Turning southward and westward from Auray, a drive of eight
or nine miles across a dreary-looking district, with patches of pasture
interspersed with gorse and ferns, and here and there a peasant leading
a cow, driving a cart, or digging in the poor soil—on reaching a rising
ground, we see before us a wide stretch of open land, grey and
monotonous in colour, and beyond, in the far distance, the horizon
line of sea. Leaving the carriage-road, about a mile before reaching
the village of Carnac, and turning off to the left, we come rather
suddenly, as it seems, upon a stubble field strewn with large grey
rocks or stones, some of them six or eight feet high, standing on end,
upright, or leaning against each other, but the majority lying <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pêle-mêle</span></i>
on the ground, some half buried in the earth, or hidden by gorse or
long grass. They are for the most part smooth and time-worn blocks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of, apparently unhewn, granite, of all shapes and sizes, some covered
with moss and lichen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Is this, then, the famous field of Carnac, with its “avenues of
menhirs,” the object of so many pilgrimages, the origin of so many
theories, the birthplace of so many legends? The first impression, we
need hardly say, is disappointing, and fills the traveller with that
feeling of blank dismay which comes upon him on the first sight of
the “Court of Lions” at the Alhambra in Spain. But in a little while,
looking westward, and tracing a certain order and method in the
position of “the Stones,” he begins to realise that by no ordinary
forces of nature, but by some unknown hands in past ages, these
pillars must have been raised. But how raised, and by whom
brought and strewn on this desolate shore? That they were monuments
of the dead, or that they mark the spot where burials took
place, forming a consecrated ground for the ancient inhabitants of
Armorica, is the commonly received opinion. We are told also that
these irregular rows of unhewn stone are relics of serpent worship,
that they represent serpents’ teeth and the waving lines of its body;
also that they mark the places of sacrifice of the Druids; bones and
ancient remains of human beings having been found to support this
theory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “menhir,” or “long stone of the sun,” will suggest the
form of monument used in all ages in religious worship, and the
“dolmen,” or table stone (which we see in the neighbourhood of
Locmariaker), consisting of a chamber formed by placing one large
flat stone horizontally on two or more upright blocks, points to the
theory of a place of sacrifice in Druidical times, or at any rate to
a place of burial.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> All else seems vague and mysterious, leading men
of succeeding ages to surround the scene with legends and traditions.
It has been said that “the ancient temples of aboriginal races
are generally to be found where nature wears her saddest and most
funereal aspect,” and certainly Carnac is no exception to the rule.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The forms of the menhir and the dolmen are indicated on the title-page.</p>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>It is a summer’s day, and the light south wind that comes over
the sea, and gently sways the trees inland, here blows up the sand
into our faces, and moans between the stones. It is such a wild and
dreary place—where, excepting for a farm and an oasis of a few trees,
there is no welcome colour presented to the eye—that the mind leans
naturally to the mysterious side, and clings rather to legend and
tradition than to historic facts; thus we may see in this confused
array an army of pagan warriors turned into stone, and cling, like
the present inhabitants of Carnac, to the story of the patron saint of
their herds and flocks (St. Cornély), who, pursued to the sea by a host
of armed men, and finding no means of escape, cursed his pursuers and
turned them into stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, by the aid of the map below, we look down upon the fields of
Carnac, we shall discern a certain
order and method in the arrangement
of the stones, and carry
away a more definite impression.
Thus we see the menhirs (or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peulvens</span></i>,
“pillars of stone,” as they
would be more accurately described)
arranged in three avenues
extending from east to west, commencing
irregularly at Kerlescant,
continuing in a second group called Kermario, and ending abruptly
near Carnac. These avenues form the principal groups, but there are
two others, one at Erdeven and one at Ste. Barbe, in a north-westerly
direction, besides separate menhirs or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peulvens</span></i>, scattered about for
miles, half buried in the soil or standing in the long grass. It
is estimated by old chroniclers that on these fields there once were
12,000 or 15,000 Celtic monuments; at the present time there are
not 1000 to be found upon the fields of Carnac, so many having
been destroyed or taken away for building or other purposes.</p>

<div  class='figleft id004'>
<img src='images/illus158_smmap.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The most prominent object on the field of Carnac is a mound of
stones, once a burial-place, on which there is a chapel and a calvary
dedicated to St. Michel. Every traveller ascends this mound to
obtain a view, on the one side, of the plains of Carnac, and, on the
other, of the peninsula of Quiberon and of the distant islands of Belle-Île,
Houath, and Hoedic. From the mound we can also see the
spot where the ruins of Roman houses and baths have been found.
On the right, as we look seaward, is the little village of Carnac close
at hand, with its grey spire and cluster of houses, and here and there
in the distance are trees, farms, and patches of cultivation. But all
looks dreary and wind-blown, even in summer-time and the inhabitants
that stop in their work in the fields to stare, or pursue the tourist
through the day, have a wild and weary look that is infinitely sad.</p>

<p>SKETCH ON THE FIELDS OF CARNAC.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>In the church of Carnac are some curious relics, and frescoes
descriptive of events in the life of St. Cornély, and in a house
opposite is a collection of ancient ornaments, weapons, bone
implements, and the like, which have been unearthed from time to
time, and are now exhibited for a small fee. Visitors to Carnac
should make enquiry for the site of recent excavations made by
Mr. Miln, a Scotch gentleman who has devoted some years to
archæological labours in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Descending to the village of Carnac, the traveller finds a comfortable
resting-place at the Hôtel des Voyageurs, and a pleasant contrast to
the prevailing sadness of the outer world. In this old-fashioned inn
a sumptuous breakfast is prepared in summer for visitors; and here
assemble, at midday, the more prosperous part of the community,
including priests of antiquarian taste, small farmers, traders in fish,
travelling merchants, carriage drivers, and others. The kitchen should
be seen by all visitors, with its old fireplace and furniture, ancient
clock, and comfortable beds; the pleasant faces and homely welcome
of the people giving colour and character to the picture. For a few
weeks in summer-time, and at the time of the Pardon of Ste. Anne
d’Auray, this little inn is a centre of attraction; it is close to the
church, where, round its walls in grave procession, peasants still bring
their cattle to be cured—kneeling and praying, in the road, for
miraculous aid.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Turning to the north-west, about two miles on the road to Erdeven,
is Plouharnel, a village somewhat poor in its surroundings, but giving
comfortable accommodation to travellers who come to see the dolmen
of Corcorro, one of the largest in Brittany. It consists of three
chambers, or “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">allées couvertes</span>,” which were opened in 1830 and found
to contain fragments of earthen vessels,
and an urn containing ashes, gold necklaces,
&amp;c. The enormous slabs which
rest upon and project beyond the upright
stones, measured originally, it is
supposed, about forty-five feet; the
dolmen now measures twenty-four feet
by twelve; it was formerly underground,
but now stands in the open
moorland.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus161.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>The landlord of the inn at Plouharnel
formed a collection of relics in 1849,
including celts of jade and bronze,
taken from this and other dolmens in
the neighbourhood. It should be noted
that these relics belong to a much later
period than others found near Locmariaker,
some of which are to be seen at
the Museum of Antiquities at Vannes.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c000'>The second principal excursion from Auray is to <span class='sc'>Locmariaker</span>
and the island of Gâvr Innis. Locmariaker, or “the place of the Virgin
Mary,” is situated nine miles in a southerly direction from Auray,
and the island of Gâvr Innis (Goat Island) is one of a cluster of little
islands two miles east of Locmariaker. At the extremity of the
peninsula are two large mounds or tumuli, where various implements
and relics have been found, pointing to the time of the Roman
occupation of Gaul; and side by side with these, remains of dolmens
and menhirs of a much earlier date.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The Montagne de la Fée, a tumulus of stones about thirty feet
high, was excavated in 1863, and in the vaulted chamber or grotto
were found necklaces, beads, and other ornaments which may be seen in
the museum at Vannes. There is a guide who shows the interior to
visitors, and points to the hatchet-shaped inscriptions on the stones.
In the Mané Lud, the second great tumulus opened in 1863, was
found a large chamber, supposed to have been a sepulchre, containing
the skeletons of horses’ heads, as well as other bones.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus162.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>After visiting the tumuli, we cross the fields a little way from
Locmariaker, following upon the track of three priests, to see the
great fallen menhir, called “Men-er-Groách,” or “Stone of the Fairies.”
It is as wild and wind-blown here as at Carnac; in every direction,
excepting due north, is the sea, and beyond the sea is a strong
south-west wind. The sun that shines upon the islands, and light
up the colours of the lichen on the rocks out at sea, scarce illumines
the foreground; there is no relief upon the low land but mounds
of earth covered with long grass and furze, and here and there, half
buried in the ground, grey rocks, strewn about as if by some convulsion
of nature. There is no trace of man’s handling, as far as we
can see; nothing to suggest a monument, and nothing, by contrast,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to give an idea of size. But all at once, as we descend a little behind
some clumps of heather, there loom up before us against the sea and
sky the dark rounded sides of two enormous stones, half buried in
the ground, but raised once, as history and tradition tell us, in the
form of an obelisk seventy feet high and sixteen feet in diameter!
All is silent but the wind coming through distant pines, scattering the
gorse blossom on the ground, and bending the long grass. There are
rooks floating in the air, and presently there is a flapping of black
garments as three pilgrims appear upon the more distant portion of
the menhir, clambering down its side. It is an undignified contrast,
but valuable to us for the impression of size and grandeur it gives to
the fallen monument.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus163.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Two miles off, on the inland sea of Morbihan—approached
easily by boats at certain times of the tide, but often with great
difficulty owing to the currents—is the small island called Gâvr Innis.
This island is about three quarters of a mile in length, and is green
and cultivated, but so difficult is the approach that it is only in
summer-time that there is much communication with the mainland.
On a summer’s day a few adventurous tourists come scrambling up
the wet rocks from boats, to visit the tumulus or mound of stones
which has been excavated of late years, and in which there have
been found various Celtic remains and inscriptions. It is, outwardly,
a mound or heap of stones about 300 feet in circumference, and not
more than 30 feet high.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Of the origin, or use, of these tumuli, of which the one on
Gâvr Innis is the most remarkable in Brittany, neither antiquaries
of the past nor the present owner, M. Closmedenc, who lives on the
island in summer, can give a satisfactory account. Like the island of
Avalon, it sleeps in an atmosphere of romance and mystery; the most
searching of modern antiquaries speaking of the “circular and serpent-like
waving lines” cut on the stones of Gâvr Innis as “unaccountable,”
and of the inscriptions as of “unknown meaning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here we may pause, wondering no longer at the superstitions
of the peasants, or the romances and legends of the people of
Morbihan.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_4 c006'>A few miles from Auray and
Carnac is the ancient city of
<span class='sc'>Vannes</span>, the chief town of the department

its position, is the natural point of
departure for travellers entering Brittany

<p class='c000'>There is not much to attract the traveller at first sight, but the
result of several visits is to leave an impression of great interest
on the mind. One of <em>the</em> oldest, perhaps the oldest, of the cities
of ancient Armorica, its very name and its position carry us back
to early history, when the fleets of the Veneti commanded these
seas, and were finally conquered by Cæsar in the sea of Morbihan,
their leaders put to death, and their people sold for slaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The part of Vannes of most interest to travellers is the old city
with its narrow streets and overhanging houses, and the remains
of its walls and gates. In the narrowest part, near the Place Henri-Quatre,
there rises between the eaves of the houses the square
tower and spire of the cathedral of St. Peter, a structure dating
from the eleventh century, altered and almost rebuilt in the
fifteenth. The interior of the cathedral is gloomy, and the streets which
surround it are dark and old. There are some cloisters and a finely
sculptured porch of dark stone. The principal chapel in the interior is
dedicated to the Spanish Dominican monk St. Vincent Ferrier, who
evangelised the province in the time of Duke John V., and died at
Vannes in 1419. The relics of this saint are once a year carried in
procession round the town.</p>

<p>SKETCH OF VANNES FROM THE RIVER.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>There is one side chapel with an altar, on which are three glass
cases, in one of which are relics, and, apparently, some wax models
of bones and imitation jewels; above these, between the folds of a
curtain half drawn aside, is a painting of Ste. Marie de Bon Secours,
to whom the chapel is dedicated. The light through a narrow stained-glass
window falls upon the figure of an old woman, holding beads in
her worn hands, who kneels upon the scagliola steps before the altar.
There is nothing uncommon in the sight; but there is a romantic story
that this old woman and the beautiful Madonna are one and the same;
that she had sat in her youth as a model for the Holy Virgin, and
that she kneels every day before the portrait of her old self.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have spoken of the cathedral and of its patron saint, because
Vannes is an ecclesiastical city of importance, the see of an ancient
bishopric, and a radiating point for the church in Morbihan; but, as
a matter of fact, we see and hear very little of the church at Vannes;
and it seems by contrast with the country—where every wayside
has its cross or holy fountain, every district its little chapel or altar
with saints and relics amongst the trees, every group of peasant-women
a pastor—that the country people have more than their share of
homilies and exhortations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming from the interior, we miss the attitude of religious awe
amongst the women, which seems to be put off at the city gates; and
we miss, also, the individuality of costume which vanishes fast in towns.
If we were to picture the people as we see them on Sunday in
Vannes, they would be very ordinary indeed, with just a sprinkling of
white caps, and a few touches of embroidery on a shawl or a blouse,
to remind us that we are in Morbihan; and in their general attitude
they would seem as much at a loss for occupation as in other centres
of civilisation where galleries and museums are closed on Sundays.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a museum of Celtic antiquities at Vannes, containing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>collection of ornaments, flints, &amp;c., found in the cromlechs at Carnac
and the neighbourhood, which is well worth visiting; and there are
various shows and amusements for the people on the <em>Place</em> and in
the public gardens; but the fact remains that the majority of the
working inhabitants sidle off on Sunday morning as we see them in
the sketch, gravitating one by one towards every house outside of
which hangs a bunch of dried mistletoe or broom.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus167.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>There are many picturesque old houses such as the above; there
is a walk by the river under the old walls and towers, and another
in the upper town with a view far away towards Nantes and the sea;
and there is almost southern warmth and colour under its sunny
walls, where we are sheltered from the winds of the Morbihan.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>The people that we see are for the most part pleasant and
prosperous-looking, busy in commerce or in agriculture. There is,
it is true, more than one regiment of the line quartered here, and
the cafés, bright with plate-glass and gilding, are full of warriors of
various sizes; in the morning and in the evening the air vibrates
with regimental drums, but there is little else to remind us that the
inhabitants are the direct descendants of a warlike nation, and that
barons and knights once defended the battlements and towers of Vannes.
The morning is spent at billiards in most of the cafés, and in some,
especially frequented by the townspeople, there are such groups as
the above.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus168.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Outside the café, seated on a bench, is a French commercial
traveller, dressed like a common dandy from L’Orient, with blue frock-coat,
white trousers, very narrow at the bottom, hair cut close to
the head, and a portentous moustache; and he does with it what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>every human creature seems to do with an artificially contrived tuft
of hair on his upper lip, he twitches it round and round and pulls at
it without ceasing; he has done this every day for many years, and
the action, apparently, relieves his mind. The sight is familiar in
civilised communities, but this figure contrasts so strongly with the
clean-faced, dignified Bretons that it seems time to pack up our sketchbooks
and depart.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Three Hot Men of Vannes.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Are the fashions changing in Brittany? or is it only the usual
tourists’ cry, the complaint of those who resent all change in costume
and dwellings in order that villages should remain “picturesque,” who
look upon their brother living in a hovel as they do upon an
old door-knocker or a china plate? Let us think of the influences
at work in out-of-the-way places, where the travelling <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">marchand des
bottes</span></i>, who has followed us through nearly every village in Brittany
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>with his caravan of side-spring boots, plies his terrible trade; and let
us remember the expression on the faces of the dancers in the
booth at Châteauneuf du Faou, at the arrival from Quimper of the
“fine lady,” who stands up with her relations to dance the gavotte in
the latest fashion of the towns.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus170.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Vannes, we should go down at night to the old
Place Henri-Quatre, where the roofs of the houses meet overhead,
where, in moonlight, the gables cast wonderful shadows across the
square, and above our heads rise the towers of the cathedral with a
grandeur of effect not to be seen at any other time, or from any other
point of view. It is then that the cathedral precincts look most
mysterious in their darkness; narrow, irregular streets with open
gutters, lighted only by a glimmer from latticed windows, and where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>from old doorways, figures are dimly seen to pass in and out. It is a
poor quarter, where a Dutch painter would find work for a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c000'>We said that there was no light in the streets, but, passing round
the cathedral, there is a strong light from a lantern held close to
the ground; it is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chiffonnier</span></i> of Vannes (who, like his Parisian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrère</span></i>,
has learned the art of pecking and discrimination from the
fowls) wandering through the night with his basket and iron wand.</p>

<p class='c000'>One more note made in Vannes in stormy autumn-time. We go
down to the port, sheltered from the wind by a high wall, through
which narrow passages have been made to reach the sea. It is
nearly dusk, and the rough-hewn edges of the stone wall stand out
sharply against the sky. As we pass one of these, facing the west,
the narrow opening to the shore is illumined by a blood-red sunset
light, so bright by contrast that three figures coming towards us
from the seashore step, as it were, out of a furnace. They have
men’s voices, but as they approach and pass us hurriedly, we see
that their heads are bare, and that their robes touch the ground.
Upon their shoulders they carry a “dear brother” to his rest—the
drift of last night’s storm-tide. Next morning a rough stone cottage-door
just outside the town is hung round with black—the drapery
giving an appearance of height, and almost grandeur of dimensions, to
the little interior—and resting upon the step is the projecting end of
a wooden coffin painted white. There are candles burning on either
side; a metal crucifix is placed on the doorstep, and on a little table
on the ground in the road is a vase of flowers. The neighbours pass
up and down crossing themselves, and muttering Latin words of prayer
for the dead, and the little children stand and stare. Two days after
there is a bright procession, headed by a priest and acolytes in white
robes, with hymns and incense, followed by a little crowd bareheaded,
all struggling against the wind, to a plot of ground on a promontory
near the seashore, where the poor Breton is taken to his rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a crowd of his forefathers here before him, with black
wooden crosses where their heads should be; they are planted out in
rows, and labelled with wooden sticks to mark their species, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>garden is walled in with stones and great rock boulders to keep out
the wind. But it is a dreary place; the wind finds it out from behind
the stones, blows down the wooden crosses, and strews the ground with
seaweed and dead leaves; nothing resists the havoc of the wind over
the graves, but some bright yellow <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">immortelles</span></i> and some metal
images of the Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the neighbourhood of Vannes there are numerous interesting
excursions to be made, especially southward to the peninsula of
Rhuys, on the south side of the sea of Morbihan, to Sarzeau (where
Lesage, the author of <cite>Gil Blas</cite>, was born), and to the abbey of St.
Gildas, also to the ruins of the fortress of Sucinio, built in 1250
by Duke Jean de Roux. A few miles to the north-west is the
military town of Pontivy, now called Napoléonville, to be reached
easily by railway from Vannes; and near it the village of St.
Nicodème (<em>see map</em>), where on the first Saturday in August one of
the largest gatherings of the people takes place. The Pardon of
St. Nicodème is as interesting as any described in this book, but
the customs and ceremonies are too similar to others to be described
without wearying the reader with repetition.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little farther south, and we should enter the department of the
Loire-Inférieure; we are in fact but a few miles from the city of
Nantes, so well described by Miss Betham-Edwards, in <em>A Year in
Western France</em>. In this neighbourhood are the sunny vineyards of
St. Nazaire, the salt districts of Croisic where the costumes of the
inhabitants are again most curious, and the little sea-coast villages
pictured by Mr. Wedmore in his <cite>Pastorals of France</cite>; but there is
enough in the Loire-Inférieure for a separate book, peopled by Breton
folk of an altogether different type.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have said little of the ancient châteaux of Brittany, many of
which are in good preservation, and are inhabited by direct descendants
of the barons of the fifteenth century; but we would suggest to
the traveller, before leaving Vannes, to visit the picturesque castle of
Elven, where Henry of Richmond, afterwards king of England, was
confined for fifteen years; and, if possible, to go by road to Josselin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>where there is one of the finest châteaux of the Renaissance. The
numerous sketches, of Breton folk, in this book have prevented us
from dwelling more at length on the architectural features of the
country, which have been described in many books of travel.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus171.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>What clings to our recollections of Brittany? Some things that
are not beautiful, and which by no stretch of fancy can be described
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en couleur de rose</span></i>. The public exhibition of disease and human
deformities permitted by the church are sights to which English eyes
are unaccustomed, and of which the young and untravelled part of
our community have happily little knowledge. But no wise determination
to see only the “bright side” of things, no infusion of otto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of roses amongst these leaves, can take away the stain that clings
to many things in Brittany.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem a consideration of some consequence to the
numerous English residents abroad, though we seldom hear it touched
upon, that their children must of necessity be brought in contact with
so much that is cruel and repulsive. Some may think it salutary and
right to see these things; at any rate it is part of the bargain with
those who live abroad, and the habits of the people can scarcely be
interfered with; but it is a source of wonder to visitors to the principal
towns that the residents cannot persuade the authorities to keep more
decently their streets and public ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>We will not dwell upon the cruelty to animals, upon the sights
to be witnessed in every market-town, such as tortured calves and half
suffocated pigs, because cruelty is everywhere, and we as strangers
are helpless in a land where it is not considered a sin to inflict
suffering upon animals. It is true that any very flagrant acts can be
dealt with by law, but the law is seldom enforced.</p>

<p class='c000'>What does it matter about <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les animaux</span></i>? asks the kindest-hearted,
most motherly of Breton women, whose children drag live birds through
the dust as playthings, and whose husband, if he be of a scientific turn,
may perchance keep a grasshopper with a pin through his head, <em>living</em>,
for days in a glass case!</p>

<p class='c000'>But our lasting impressions of Brittany are of a people and of
a country, interesting for their isolation from the rest of Europe:
of a people who are, as has been well said, “dwelling in an heroic
past that possibly never existed, consoling the failures of their destiny
by beautiful fancies, and throwing a grace over their hard, unhopeful
lives with romantic dreams and traditions”; of a people who invest
every road and fountain with a holy name—for wherever two roads
meet, there is a cross or a sign, and wherever three streams meet,
they are called La Trinité;—of a land that stands alone in Western
Europe, its rocks unmoved by the shocks of tempest from without,
and its manners unpolished by advancing civilisation from within;
of a land where men look to the sea as well as to the earth for their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>harvest, where the plough comes down to the water’s edge and the
nets of the fishermen are dried upon fig-trees, where laden orchards
drop their fruit over weather-worn walls on to the sands, and fish,
leaping from the sea, alight sometimes in a field of corn; of a land
brightened for a few weeks in summer with the flower of buckwheat,
and coloured with the coral of its stems, where the wind sweeps over
waves of grass and grain, and scatters the harvest over the sea.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
